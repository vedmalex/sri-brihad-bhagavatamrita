**“Their minds absorbed in thoughts of Him, they conversed about Him, acted out His pastimes, and felt themselves filled with His presence. They completely forgot about their homes as they loudly sang the glories of Kṛṣṇa's transcendental qualities.”**

#### комментарий

This verse (Bhāgavatam 10.30.43) describes how the force of love for Kṛṣṇa made the gopīs forget everything else. At the beginning of the rāsa dance, when Kṛṣṇa disappeared, leaving the gopīs in total distress, they searched everywhere but couldn't find Him. By the time they gave up their search, they had wandered far into the thickest part of the forest, where even the light of the autumn moon couldn't go. Under the circumstances, one would have expected them to go home in disappointment, but they couldn't even remember that they had homes. In this condition, instead of complaining about Kṛṣṇa's cruelty, the surrendered gopīs continued to sing His glories. All their faculties were fixed on Him: their minds, with which they could only accept Him, never reject Him; their power of speech, by which they called out plaintively to Him and performed His saṅkīrtana; and their other working senses, by which they made garlands and beds from flowers and leaves. Mind, body, and words, the gopīs were fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa; their whole existence was dedicated to Him. Even at home the gopīs were so focused on Kṛṣṇa in thought, word, and deed that they went about their household duties oblivious of what was going on around them. Now that they were outside, why should they give any thought to their homes? Abandoned by Kṛṣṇa in the forest in the midst of the night, they simply went on chanting His glories.

Another meaning of the words tan-manaskās tad-ālāpās tad-viceṣṭās tad-ātmikāḥ is that in the anxiety of separation the gopīs became so intense in their remembrance of Kṛṣṇa, the enthusiastic enjoyer of wonderful pastimes, that they began to assume the unique characteristics of His personality. Their minds, just like His, became free from fear and suffering. Their speech became grave, articulate, and charming, just like His. They started to behave just like Him, embracing and kissing one another. Their bodies even appeared like His, as they emulated His threefold-bending posture. But unlike impersonal yogīs who forget devotion to God as they begin to develop His qualities, the gopīs only increased in their natural devotion for Kṛṣṇa more and more, and they went on singing His glories. In this utter absorption in Kṛṣṇa, they forgot themselves, what to speak of the homes and other things they were meant to enjoy.

#### комментарий

Texts 135 though 137 (Bhāgavatam 10.44.14–16) are spoken by the women of Mathurā who watch Kṛṣṇa as He enters Kaṁsa's arena to wrestle with Cāṇūra. The ladies of Mathurā praise the gopīs of Vṛndāvana because the gopīs can always enjoy seeing Kṛṣṇa and chanting His glories, in all circumstances.

First the ladies praise the gopīs for being always able to see the beauty of Kṛṣṇa's transcendental form. The Vedic scriptures explain various benefits to be gained by a variety of disciplines, but the women of Mathurā have never heard of anyone receiving such a benefit as bestowed upon the gopīs. What penances, religious duties, or meditation could enable one to attain such perfection? What tapas could the gopīs of Vraja have performed to earn the privilege of drinking Kṛṣṇa's beauty with their mortal eyes, directly relishing His beauty the way one relishes nectar with the tongue? Out of reverence for Kṛṣṇa, at this moment the city women cannot utter His name, but can only refer to the son of Nanda as “Him.”

According to the description of the Mathurā women, Kṛṣṇa is the most charming of persons. Indeed, He embodies the very essence of charm. Even those who consider Him an avatāra of Viṣṇu cannot find any avatāra equal to Him; and persons who know that He is in fact the source of all avatāras can understand that no one is greater. Moreover, His supreme excellence is not created by anyone or anything else. His excellence is not lent to Him by His ornaments; it is innately His own. As Śrī Uddhava states in the Third Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (3.2.12):

> yan martya-līlaupayikaṁ sva-yoga-<br/>
> māyā-balaṁ darśayatā gṛhītam<br/>
> vismāpanaṁ svasya ca saubhagarddheḥ<br/>
> paraṁ padaṁ bhūṣaṇa-bhūṣaṇāṅgam<br/>

“The Lord, by His internal potency, Yogamāyā, appeared in the mortal world in His eternal form, just suitable for His pastimes. Those pastimes were wondrous for all, even for those who were proud of their own opulence, including the Lord Himself in His form as the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha. Thus Śrī Kṛṣṇa's transcendental body is the ornament of all ornaments.”

Ananya-siddham can also be understood in another way, as meaning that these excellences of Kṛṣṇa are not realized anywhere else but in Vraja. Furthermore, persons who taste Kṛṣṇa's glories are never satiated; rather, they always experience those glories as newer and newer at ever moment. As the poet Māgha says, kṣaṇe kṣaṇe yan navatām upaiti / tad eva rūpaṁ ramaṇīyatāyāḥ: “The true form of attractiveness is that which appears newer at every moment.” Therefore the full glories of Kṛṣṇa are very difficult to realize; other than the gopīs, no one can ever expect to know them directly. And only the gopīs have Kṛṣṇa completely under their control.

Kṛṣṇa is the most charming of persons, and He possesses all supreme qualities. He is the only constant reservoir of fame, splendor, and the six divine opulences indicated by the word bhagavān. Thus both His form and His personality are in all ways supremely attractive.

In stating that the gopīs of Vraja always enjoy the sight of Kṛṣṇa's beauty, the women speaking in the wrestling arena use the present tense (pibanti). By this they mean to say that the beauty of Kṛṣṇa never actually abandons the gopīs, for the gopīs never fail to see Him, even when He is physically absent. “The gopīs are the most fortunate of women. We ladies of Mathurā are not at all pious, because we can see Him only at inauspicious times and places. There is no chance of our ever drinking the nectar of His beauty with the same love and respect as the gopīs.”

Their minds are fixed on Kṛṣṇa alone.**

#### комментарий

Even if in the course of Kṛṣṇa's infinitely varied pastimes the gopīs are sometimes unable to see that most clever Kṛṣṇa, they can remain submerged in an ocean of transcendental pleasure by chanting His glories. The gopīs do not engage in saṅkīrtana only when circumstances are conducive—when performing special services for Him like making garlands. They chant His names and glories always, in all situations. While describing the autumn rāsa dance, Parāśara Muni says in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa (5.13.52, 56):

> kṛṣṇaḥ śarac-candramasaṁ<br/>
> kaumudī-kumudākaram<br/>
> jagau gopī-gaṇās tv ekaṁ<br/>
> kṛṣṇa-nāma punaḥ punaḥ<br/>
> <br/>

“Kṛṣṇa sang about the autumn moon and its light upon the lotus ponds, while the gopīs simply sang Kṛṣṇa's name over and over again.”

> rāsa-geyaṁ jagau kṛṣṇo<br/>
> yāvat tārāyata-dhvaniḥ<br/>
> sādhu kṛṣṇeti kṛṣṇeti<br/>
> tāvat tā dvi-guṇaṁ jaguḥ<br/>

“While Kṛṣṇa sang a rāsa-dance song in a resonant voice, the gopīs congratulated Him and redoubled their chanting of 'Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!'”

In the verse Parīkṣit Maharaja recites here, the phrase vraja-striyaḥ (“the women of Vraja”) indicates not just the gopīs but also women who live in the forest. The city ladies who are speaking are not careful to distinguish between the gopīs of Nanda's community and the other women of Vraja, who are mostly aborigines. All the women who come in contact with Kṛṣṇa in the forest, whether children, young girls, or old women, become rich in the highest favor of the goddess of fortune. And only the women of Vraja have this kind of excellent luck, not the women of any other place.

Why are the women of Vraja so fortunate? Because they always engage in kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana, no matter what else they do. They sing while they milk the cows and churn butter for their husbands and children, while they apply kuṅkuma, candana, and other cosmetics to their bodies, while they swing on swings, while they comfort their babies, while they clean their houses with water and cow dung. They sing Kṛṣṇa's names while cooking, grinding grains, smearing the courtyards with auspicious pastes, and beautifying the walls of their houses with painted designs. Thus the gopīs' unavoidable duties in taking care of their families and maintaining their own bodies do not at all obstruct the ecstasy the gopīs feel in worshiping Kṛṣṇa; rather, these contribute to it by giving suitable occasions for saṅkīrtana.

The gopīs are so absorbed in Kṛṣṇa's glories that they are hardly aware of the effort they expend while working. And so intense is their singing that they actually see Kṛṣṇa. Either by the power of meditation they see Him in their hearts as He plays all around Vraja-bhūmi, or else they make excuses to take their work out into the pastures and so directly see Him playing there. Sometimes the presence of their elders makes them too shy to sing about Kṛṣṇa, and then they fly to where Kṛṣṇa is by the inner vehicle of their minds, helplessly attracted by the power of Lord Urukrama, who intrudes by stealth into the minds of His best devotees. As the gopīs chant about Kṛṣṇa, their minds are more and more attracted to Him, and gradually they are unable to think coherently about anything else. Shedding tears of love, they sob uncontrollably, and their hearts go swiftly (uru-krameṇa) to join Kṛṣṇa, wherever He is. In short, they are the most fortunate of women because they always see Kṛṣṇa, always chant His glories, always think about Him, and always feel completely attracted to Him in pure love.

The words anurakta-dhiyo 'śru-kaṇṭhyaḥ, which describe how the gopīs sing, can be understood to be a response to the following doubt: “Isn't it true that a woman does what she does only because she is attracted to doing it? The gopīs must have some attraction for household work, otherwise why would they be so busy doing it? How then can they be said to be merged totally, exclusively in love for Kṛṣṇa?” The Mathurā women respond by commenting that such symptoms as tears in the eyes prove that the gopīs' minds are full of loving attraction for Kṛṣṇa. The gopīs do their household duties only for His sake.

But then another doubt might arise: “With such distracted minds, how could the gopīs maintain their bodies and fulfill their family responsibilities?” The answer is that Kṛṣṇa is Urukrama, the Supreme Lord who possesses amazing energies and accomplishes wonderful feats. The gopīs, by fixing their hearts on Him, are easily able to carry out all their duties and obtain whatever is needed. Even though the gopīs think only of Kṛṣṇa, to the exclusion of everything else, they are free from anxiety over the many duties they are obliged to fulfill. Everything they do is for His satisfaction, so they can do everything expertly simply by the force of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

This verse also describes the gopīs' singing about Kṛṣṇa as most prominent. Their remembrance and visions of Him come as natural consequences of this primary service of singing His glories. Therefore the gopīs' meditating on Kṛṣṇa and envisioning Him are not explicitly mentioned. The ladies of Mathurā conclude, “These women alone are the most fortunate, and in ways for which we can never aspire. How sad!”

#### перевод

**“When the young gopīs hear Kṛṣṇa playing His flute as He leaves Vraja in the morning with His cows or returns with them at sunset, they quickly come out of their houses to see Him. They must have performed many pious activities to be able to see Him as He walks on the road, His smiling face mercifully glancing upon them.”**

#### комментарий

“We ladies of Mathurā may also have the privilege of seeing Kṛṣṇa in all His glory, and we too may be able to glorify Him in saṅkīrtana while we engage in our activities—at least after He kills Kaṁsa and remains here with us. But the experience will never be the same for us as for the gopīs of Vraja. For only they can watch Kṛṣṇa in the morning as He leaves for the forest and in the evening as He returns home. Only they can see Him surrounded by His cows and His cowherd friends. As soon as the gopīs hear His flute, they come outside, onto the road on which He will walk. They may be powerless women (abalāḥ), devoid of independent strength, but still they are the most fortunate and pious of human beings.”

When Kṛṣṇa comes into view, the gopīs not only see Him but also hear His flute song and the jingling of His foot bells as He walks with the grace of a skilled dancer. Kṛṣṇa's face is always adorned with merciful glances, and no one ever sees it not smiling. The gopīs, however, even while gazing on Kṛṣṇa's beauty, are in anxiety because they know that He will soon be out of sight. What is so fortunate about seeing Kṛṣṇa go off to the forest? What is so auspicious about being left in the anguish of separation? In fact, however, anything in connection with Kṛṣṇa is auspicious, even when it superficially appears to be a cause for suffering. The gopīs may see Him leave in the morning, but they also see Him return in the late afternoon. Having languished in their homes during the day, like lotuses almost dead from being overexposed to sunlight, the gopīs rush out of their houses as soon as the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's flute song enters their ears. Each time they see Kṛṣṇa is like a festival for them. Every morning they make various excuses to come early to Mother Yaśodā's house to see Kṛṣṇa and follow Him as He leaves for the forest. They are completely absorbed, morning and evening, in meditating on how to get out of their houses to be near Kṛṣṇa—but when they hear Him playing His flute they at once run outside, for the sound of the flute arouses in them the urges of Cupid, rendering them helpless and weak (abalāḥ).

As repeatedly explained in Śrī Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta, the gopīs receive the greatest mercy of the Personality of Godhead when they are immersed in the mood of separation. Nonetheless, the women of Mathurā limit themselves to describing the ecstasy of seeing Kṛṣṇa, because the sublime subject of the gopīs' feelings of separation is beyond their grasp. And they dare not even mention the supreme glories of Kṛṣṇa's rāsa-līlā. Since the wonder of merely seeing Kṛṣṇa is difficult for the Mathurā women to describe, what can they tell about the gopīs' greatest fortune—being able to dance with Kṛṣṇa in the rāsa-līlā? The Mathurā women lament, “Because our stock of pious credits is so meager, we will never be able to see Kṛṣṇa in this same way.”

#### комментарий

This verse (Bhāgavatam 10.32.22) describes the most exalted position of the gopīs, earned by their pure love for the Personality of Godhead. When Kṛṣṇa suddenly disappeared at the beginning of the rāsa dance, the gopīs cried in great pain. But then He reappeared, sat comfortably in their midst, and listened to their eager questions. The present verse is Kṛṣṇa's answer to those questions.

Texts 138 through 146 tell of the Supreme Lord's special love for the gopīs. In these nine verses the Lord Himself, from His own lotus mouth, explains this wonderful aspect of His own glories.

The gopīs are faultless in their love for Kṛṣṇa. Neglecting all considerations other than making Him happy, they submerge their minds in thoughts of Him in spotless prema. Surely these girls should not be criticized for approaching Kṛṣṇa with lust, even though followers of the smṛti-śāstras may want to criticize them. Their “lust” for Kṛṣṇa is in fact a great virtue, since it is the cause of their faultless association with Him. As previously shown in this book, the gopīs' attraction to Kṛṣṇa is an exceptional development of their fully matured love of God. In fact, Kṛṣṇa considers Himself unable to repay the gopīs for their devotion, even in a lifetime of the intelligent demigods or sages or the supremely intelligent Lord Brahmā. If we read sva-sādhu-kṛtyam to mean “proper compensation,” the Lord says that He is unable to repay the gopīs for their devotion. And if we read it, alternatively, to mean “one's own saintly behavior,” the Lord says that He cannot act with the same exceptionally saintly devotion for them as they have for Him.

Kṛṣṇa is amazed by how strongly committed to Him the gopīs are. They have cut the insurmountable knots of attachment to home and husband and children and the multitude of duties centered on them. Severing these attachments, the gopīs have worshiped Kṛṣṇa fully, whereas Kṛṣṇa, because He has ties of love to so many devotees, feels He can never be as exclusively dedicated. Therefore He can only suggest to the gopīs that their own saintliness might repay His debt to them. There is nothing He can do in kind to reciprocate.

Dividing the phrase sva-sādhu-kṛtyam differently yields yet another understanding. Su-asādhu-kṛtyam (which changes to sv-asādhu-kṛtyam) means “very unvirtuous acts.” Thus Kṛṣṇa indicates that even the things the gopīs do that lack virtue, such as behaving cruelly toward Him, are glorious. Even those acts, Kṛṣṇa suggests, contribute to absolving His debt, so what then of the pious things the gopīs do? Kṛṣṇa says this to the gopīs out of greed to enjoy with them in all situations, no matter how they treat Him.

Unfortunately, Kṛṣṇa cannot properly repay the service of the gopīs, who have offered Him their faultless bodies (niravadya-saṁyujām). Kṛṣṇa is encumbered by various household duties of His own, like His constant duty to tend the cows. He cannot abandon His responsibilities and serve the gopīs properly (mā bhajan). And Kṛṣṇa's other obligations are unbreakable (durjarāḥ), like strong metal chains (śṛṅkhalāḥ). As implied by the prefix sam (“completely”) in the word saṁvṛścya (“completely cutting off”), Kṛṣṇa might be able to put aside His inner attachment to these other engagements, but He cannot avoid being externally involved in them.

Kṛṣṇa thinks that unless He offers Himself to the gopīs completely, as they have offered themselves to Him—unless He worships them in absolutely exclusive devotion, disregarding everything else—He cannot requite their love. He remains in debt because in His dealings with them He has broken the vow He made in Bhagavad-gītā (4.11) ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham: “As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly.”

In all humility, Kṛṣṇa sweetly requests the gopīs that for their saintly behavior they agree to be repaid by their own saintly qualities (sādhunā). Or, if we take the word sādhunā to mean “by a saintly devotee,” Kṛṣṇa suggests that although He Himself cannot reciprocate adequately, perhaps in the future some of His devotees will become followers of the gopīs and serve them faithfully.

#### комментарий

Texts 139 through 146 were spoken by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to His dear servant and best of advisors, Uddhava. What we say about another person when that person is absent usually indicates our true feelings more reliably than what we say in his presence. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's confidential statements to Uddhava about the gopīs confirm that Kṛṣṇa does indeed feel as indebted to them as He claimed while speaking with them. Kṛṣṇa wanted to do what would most help the gopīs obtain His full mercy, so instead of going to Vṛndāvana Himself, He dispatched Uddhava. He hoped that the message Uddhava was to convey would pacify the Vraja-vāsīs, whose feelings of separation were burning them like an uncontrolled forest fire. Kṛṣṇa's message was meant to sprinkle on them the nectar of His company and give them some hope that they might see Him again.

This verse and the three that follow come from the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.46.3–6). In the first half of this verse, Kṛṣṇa follows the way of ordinary dealings by asking Uddhava to console His mother and father. In the second half, He directs Uddhava to give special attention to the gopīs.

The name Uddhava means “festival,” so by using this name Kṛṣṇa implies that just by meeting Uddhava the Vraja-vāsīs should feel very much encouraged. And Kṛṣṇa refers to Himself by using the plural pronoun naḥ either because He feels proud to be the son of Nanda and Yaśodā or else because He thinks that since Nanda and Yaśodā accept Balarāma also as their son, they should accept Uddhava the same way. Surely Uddhava deserves this treatment. He is amply endowed with saintly humility and with pure devotion for Kṛṣṇa, so he should give Nanda and Yaśodā great satisfaction by his uncontrived skill in delivering Kṛṣṇa's message.

Uddhava is saumya, very mild by nature. Or else saumya indicates that since Uddhava is as beautiful as the moon (soma), Nanda and Yaśodā will be very much pleased just by seeing Him. To pacify the gopīs, however, will require more than merely Uddhava's finesse. The gopīs feel the pain of separation from Kṛṣṇa so deeply that to relieve them His own words must be conveyed. Or else Kṛṣṇa is saying that nothing less than His own words, with their pleasing tone and special connotations, will pacify both His parents and the gopīs. Still, though by hearing His message His mother and father will become happy, the gopīs will feel only limited relief. So great is their love for Him that they can never feel content in His absence.

In this verse Kṛṣṇa tells Uddhava why the gopīs need to be so carefully consoled. He also explains why He feels so obliged to them and what attributes set them apart as His greatest devotees. Because the gopīs always think about Kṛṣṇa, they appear as if possessed by insanity. And because Kṛṣṇa is their very life and soul, whenever He goes any distance away from them they seem on the verge of death. In the past they expressed their unalloyed devotion for Him by making great sacrifices. For His sake they gave up the company of their husbands, children, and homes. But now that they live in Vraja without Him they feel desolate, because they cannot resort to any other shelter than Him.

If the gopīs have actually sacrificed everything for Kṛṣṇa, why don't they just go to Mathurā to be with Him? They don't because He promised He would soon return to Vraja. That promise, as well as their concern for Kṛṣṇa's happiness, keeps them from abandoning their physical responsibilities to their husbands, children, and so on and keeps them nicely dressing and ornamenting themselves. Otherwise the gopīs would simply walk away from their families and cast aside their fine clothing and the jewelry Kṛṣṇa sent them from Mathurā. The gopīs have no attachment to any of these.

For the sake of Kṛṣṇa, the gopīs have put aside all hopes for success in this life and the next. They have abandoned all expectations of material happiness (loka) and spiritual happiness (dharma). Kṛṣṇa confesses that because the gopīs are so perfectly surrendered to Him, He takes it as His duty to maintain them, give them strength, and assure their happiness. Kṛṣṇa alone is the real source of happiness for the gopīs, and He is their real protector, much more than their husbands. Therefore Uddhava should agree to carry Kṛṣṇa's message to Vraja.

Here Kṛṣṇa uses the masculine forms of the pronouns ye and tān because, man or woman, any devotee who has such pure love deserves His protection. Nonetheless, the gopīs, through their womanly nature, manifest unique qualifications: they have made what for women is the supreme sacrifice by abandoning for Kṛṣṇa's sake their social connections (loka) and their feminine virtues of shyness and chastity (dharma).

Uddhava may worry that the gopīs, having abandoned everything, must be wandering aimlessly in the wilderness. How then will he be able to find them? And furthermore, since they have rejected all social ties, they must have become like madwomen haunted by ghosts. How then will he be able to reason with them? Kṛṣṇa assures Uddhava that even though the gopīs have for His sake abandoned loka and dharma, He watches over them and protects them. He continues to provide them the same worldly and superworldly benefits they have rejected. Thus when Uddhava reaches Vṛndāvana he will find the gopīs at home with their husbands and children, and of sane mind. What's more, Kṛṣṇa personally continues to provide even for the husbands and children the gopīs have mentally abandoned. There is no need to worry that the families of the gopīs might be uncared for, or that the community might have ostracized the husbands for having wives who have abandoned religious principles. Kṛṣṇa is protecting the gopīs' families, and of course He is protecting the gopīs themselves and their religious principles. Through His personal energies, Kṛṣṇa provides for the needs of the husbands and children, so what doubt can there be that He maintains the gopīs? He supplies their worldly needs (loka), maintains the integrity of their religious duties as women (strī-dharma), and keeps them strongly engaged in their primary interest and highest dharma—nāma-saṅkīrtana and the other essential aspects of devotional service to Him.

According to the rules for Sanskrit euphony, ye tyakta may be read as the elided form of ye atyakta, and when we take the liberty to restore the prefix a- (“not”), another meaning of the last two lines of this verse comes out: “Only for My sake have the gopīs not abandoned their worldly responsibilities [loka-dharma]. Therefore, dear Uddhava, since you are virtually equal to Me, you should go to Vraja, make the gopīs happy, protect their sanity and natural humility, and do the same for their husbands, their children, and everyone else in Vraja.”

#### комментарий

Here Kṛṣṇa speaks to His friend Uddhava with deep concern for the gopīs. Never, He tells Uddhava, has He seen in anyone such distress as the gopīs now suffer, nor has He ever heard of such misery in any historical or literary account. At every moment the gopīs are so beside themselves in the bewilderment of separation that they seem ready to leave their bodies for the abode of Death.

In this world one's spouse, children, and friends are generally very dear. Yet more dear is one's own body, and still more dear the vital air of life. More dear than life is dharma, still more dear is mokṣa, and even more dear is kṛṣṇa-bhakti, pure devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa-bhakti finds its perfect culmination in unalloyed prema, and because the gopīs are more advanced in kṛṣṇa-prema than anyone else, they are most dear to the Supreme Lord and His devotees.

For the gopīs, Kṛṣṇa Himself is the most dear object of attraction. When He goes far away to Mathurā and remains there, the gopīs nearly drown in the anxiety of separation, and stay alive only by the faint hope that He will come back to them. Unable to think and act coherently, they become as if insane. They fall into obsessive remembrance of Kṛṣṇa, thinking about how they used to associate with Him. And they become so confused and distant from reality that it becomes difficult to verify that they are still alive. The gopīs suffer greatly when Kṛṣṇa leaves them for even a moment, but when He leaves Vṛndāvana for Mathurā they approach the extreme limit of distress. Yet even though the greatness of their pain often overwhelms their minds, the gopīs cannot help but remember Kṛṣṇa.

Kṛṣṇa calls Uddhava aṅga, “dear friend,” to remind Uddhava, “I am depending on your skills as a messenger and counselor to save the lives of the gopīs by delivering My message.”

#### комментарий

In the previous verse, Kṛṣṇa described the condition of gokula-striyaḥ, which can be taken to mean all the ladies of Vraja, old as well as young. Now He focuses His attention on the vraja-gopīs who are most dear to Him—the young gopīs, such as Śrī Rādhikā. As improbable as it seems to Kṛṣṇa, these dear gopī girlfriends, including Candrāvalī, even though on the constant verge of death from the pain of separation, manage somehow to survive.

Kṛṣṇa is ashamed to confess that He intends to lie to the gopīs, yet He must explain the contents of the message He is asking Uddhava to carry. Uddhava must assure the gopīs that Kṛṣṇa will come back to them very soon. This should save the gopīs from the grips of death, just as such a message saved them once before, when Akrūra had taken Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma away from Gokula. At that time Kṛṣṇa sent a messenger with the promise that He would return after only a few days, and since the simple gopīs had full faith in Kṛṣṇa's words, they found in this promise the strength to tolerate the disappointment of losing Him. The anticipation of soon again enjoying the beauty of Kṛṣṇa gave them solace.

Aware of how daunting the task must appear, Kṛṣṇa explains to Uddhava that the gopīs, headed by Śrī Rādhikā, have dedicated themselves life and soul to Him alone. Only by Kṛṣṇa's special efforts to keep them alive do their souls stay in their bodies. The gopīs are burning in a fire of viraha-bhāva, but Kṛṣṇa is still struggling to save them.

As Kṛṣṇa indicates by the word prāyaḥ, most of the gopīs have somehow managed to survive, but some of them have already died, and others, sad to say, will also be lost. As the fire of separation grows in intensity, for the gopīs to stay alive becomes more and more difficult. In truth, only by the shelter of Kṛṣṇa's personal power, provided secretly, are the gopīs surviving at all. Kṛṣṇa doesn't want to admit this to Uddhava, who might rebuke Him for preserving the gopīs' lives. Were Kṛṣṇa to allow the gopīs to leave their bodies, their suffering would end, but by keeping them alive He is only prolonging and intensifying their torment. Yet there is something else for Uddhava to consider: Kṛṣṇa will share the gopīs' fate. Kṛṣṇa needs to be saved as much as they do. Therefore Uddhava should take most seriously his mission of bringing the gopīs a message of renewed hope.

For devotees too pained by the account of the gopīs' inner torment, this fourth verse of instruction to Uddhava can be interpreted in a different way, one that places more emphasis on how Kṛṣṇa plans to maintain the gopīs' lives. Two verses before, Kṛṣṇa gave His assurance that He sustains the gopīs through all difficulties (tān bibharmy aham). Kṛṣṇa thus promised to arrange, somehow or other, for the gopīs' happiness. And now Kṛṣṇa tells just how Uddhava can help. The way to keep the gopīs alive is to bring them Kṛṣṇa's message promising His return. Although to save them is practically impossible, this message may keep the breath of life barely flowing in the gopīs' throats. Uddhava should visit the gopīs and convince them: “Śrī Nanda-nandana is returning very soon. He is already on the way. He is practically here already.”

#### комментарий

The next four verses recited by Parīkṣit Mahārāja to his mother (texts 143 through 146) come from Kṛṣṇa's discussion with Uddhava in the Eleventh Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (11.12.10–13). When Kṛṣṇa and Uddhava were together in Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa explained to Uddhava the great value of associating with saintly devotees of the Lord. Discussing this topic reminded Kṛṣṇa of the most exalted of all saintly Vaiṣṇavas, His own beloved gopīs, and this so overwhelmed Kṛṣṇa's heart that He digressed to speak these four verses.

King Kaṁsa engaged Akrūra, the son of Śvaphalka, to bring Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā, whatever it took. Kṛṣṇa was reluctant to make the trip, but Akrūra used His wits to convince Vasudeva and Balarāma that going to Mathurā was unavoidable. By referring to Akrūra as the noble son of Śvaphalka (Śvaphalka being a worthy descendant of Yadu), Kṛṣṇa is telling Uddhava that the Vraja-vāsīs, including Kṛṣṇa Himself, have to excuse Akrūra. After all, Akrūra was only doing what he thought necessary to protect his dynasty from the wrath of Kaṁsa. Lord Balarāma, who was present when Akrūra came to Vṛndāvana, could have expertly pacified the Vraja-vāsīs, as He had done previously when Kṛṣṇa seemed imperiled in the grip of Kāliya; but this time, somehow, He made no such attempt. And when Akrūra approached Balarāma to present the plight of Vasudeva, Devakī, and the other Yadus, who were living in fear and misery under the rule of Kaṁsa, it was Balarāma who gave His consent for taking Kṛṣṇa from Vṛndāvana to Mathurā. Had it not been for this, Kṛṣṇa might never have left Vṛndāvana.

After Kṛṣṇa departed, the gopīs could find no other object of delight for their eyes. Whatever they saw reminded them that Kṛṣṇa was gone, and this only made them more miserable. With the supreme desirable object removed from their sight, everything else appeared worthless. Separation from Kṛṣṇa was like a persistent throbbing in the head that made enjoying anything in life impossible. Even before Kṛṣṇa left, the gopīs' attraction to Him had been obsessive, but now it was utterly out of control, and it tormented them like a raging fever in the brain. They entered the rarest state of ecstasy, in which nothing around them seemed able to give any happiness.

Uddhava might wonder why the gopīs, whose wisdom is praised by the most learned sages, continued to be attracted to Kṛṣṇa even after He had caused them so much anguish. Kṛṣṇa's answer is that the gopīs' love for Him was so extremely intense that nothing, not even His mistreatment of them, could impede it. As the sage Parāśara describes,

> sa tathā saha gopībhī<br/>
> rarāma madhusūdanaḥ<br/>
> yathābda-koṭi-pratimaḥ kṣaṇas tena vinābhavat<br/>
> <br/>

“Madhusūdana gave so much delight to the gopīs that later, when He was absent, a moment seemed to them like ten million years.” (Viṣṇu Purāṇa 5.13.58) Parāśara was describing to Maitreya, some years after the fact, the separation the gopīs felt, and thus he used the past tense.

The word gopī can here be understood to derive from gāḥ pānti, “they protect their senses.” The gopīs protected their senses by keeping them away from material objects. In truth the gopīs were the greatest of self-controlled yogīs. But Kṛṣṇa's charms so entranced them that they became entangled in loving affairs with Him and therefore suffered. Madhusūdana is the name of a particular bee well known for his rapacious nature of greedily collecting honey from many lotus flowers. And another Madhusūdana, known as Kṛṣṇa, took from the gopīs and ruined (sūdayati) all their honey (madhu), all their attractive, enjoyable qualities. He stole everything they had.

Kṛṣṇa here confesses to Uddhava that it is simply His nature to attract all sorts of people, exploit them for His own pleasure, enjoy them to His full, and then go away and leave them miserable. In the message Kṛṣṇa was instructing Uddhava to carry, Kṛṣṇa might have said that He Himself endured as much torment in separation from the gopīs as they did in separation from Him. But the facts prove otherwise. The gopīs surrendered to Kṛṣṇa with absolute dedication, as He Himself will describe in the next two verses; Kṛṣṇa, however, as He confesses to Uddhava, is not nearly as surrendered to them. Kṛṣṇa may have a high reputation as the most exalted of saintly persons, but in His own opinion, expressed in these verses, the gopīs are much more virtuous. In them there is not a trace of cruelty or ingratitude, and pure love for Him like theirs is not to be found anywhere else.

#### комментарий

Here Kṛṣṇa acknowledges the terrible agony the gopīs endure on His account. He addresses Uddhava as aṅga to indicate that Uddhava is as dear to Him as His own body. And He describes how the pleasure of the rāsa dance He shared with His beloved gopīs passed swiftly, as if in a single moment, even though the rāsa-līlā lasted several nights. As certain smṛti-śāstras explain, the word “nights” can also mean “days and nights.” By the Supreme Lord's special energies, the rāsa dance did not end in a single night, but lasted many nights and days. Although outsiders were unaware, Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs celebrated the rāsa-līlā for a long time, without interruption. That such an extended festival seemed to the gopīs to last only a moment proves how happy Kṛṣṇa's pure devotees become in His intimate association.

The moonlit autumn nights when Kṛṣṇa danced with the gopīs passed quickly for the gopīs, but not other nights. On other nights the suffering they underwent from Kṛṣṇa's absence seemed to last millions of years. Or if we accept that Kṛṣṇa, almost every night, would find ways to sneak out of the house to meet the gopīs, then every night passed quickly, not just the nights of the rāsa-līlā season. Only the daytimes were excruciatingly long.

Kṛṣṇa admits that the gopīs' great love for Him has cast them into utter misery. This thought might prompt a friend to suggest that Kṛṣṇa bring the gopīs to Dvārakā and again make them happy. But this idea, Kṛṣṇa answers, is not feasible. The rāsa dance was a source of delight for Him and the gopīs because they enjoyed it together in Vṛndāvana. Neither Kṛṣṇa nor the gopīs can feel the same ecstasy anywhere else. Only in Vṛndāvana does Kṛṣṇa wander among His cows and dress Himself as a cowherd. Only in the atmosphere of Vṛndāvana is the highest ecstasy perceived. Unfortunately, Kṛṣṇa confesses, He is no longer the same person as in Vṛndāvana. He has become ungrateful and hardhearted. Yet the original virtues of the gopīs have not degraded at all, and therefore Kṛṣṇa considers the gopīs much more exalted than Himself.

**“My dear Uddhava, just as great sages in yoga trance merge into self-realization, like rivers merging into the ocean, and are thus unaware of material names and forms, the gopīs of Vṛndāvana were so completely attached to Me within their minds that they could not think of their own bodies, or of this world, or of their future lives. Their entire consciousness was simply bound up in Me.**

#### комментарий

The gopīs are married women with husbands, children, and household responsibilities. How can they be considered superior to renounced, self-contented sages who have given up all material attachments? Here Kṛṣṇa answers this doubt. After sages who follow the aṣṭāṅga-yoga system become advanced in the practice of yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhyāna, and dhāraṇā, they realize the Absolute Truth as Lord Viṣṇu in their perfected trance, or samādhi. In that perfect consciousness, they forget the temporary names and forms of the material world, including the names and forms of their own bodies.

The gopīs resemble such perfect sages, for the activities of the gopīs' minds are all fixed on Kṛṣṇa in a highly developed trance, achieved by virtue of their constant connection with Kṛṣṇa, their natural relationship with Him in pure love. Like sages adept in aṣṭāṅga-yoga, the gopīs have forgotten everything of this world—their husbands and children, their own bodies (the normal objects of self-centered attachment), their individual identities as proprietors and enjoyers of the material body, and all their hopes for success in this life and the next.

As rivers abandon themselves to the waves of the ocean, the gopīs have merged their hearts in thought of Kṛṣṇa. Thus, being fully dedicated to Kṛṣṇa, they should be recognized as even greater than munis perfect in the aṣṭāṅga-yoga system. Even while standing in the midst of a blazing fire, the gopīs are not burned; rather, all their desires are fulfilled. Furthermore, simply by remaining always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the gopīs have gained the spiritual strength to easily turn away from everything material. Their hearts are irrevocably attracted to Kṛṣṇa in all circumstances, whereas munis have to struggle hard to progress through the successive methods of aṣṭāṅga-yoga. The munis must deeply concentrate to bring their minds under subjugation, and only after long endeavor can they possibly reach the goal—samādhi, in which they can forget material names and forms. The gopīs are much greater because they easily achieve samādhi.

But aren't self-contented sages like the four Kumāras considered the most advanced of saintly persons? In ordinary circles that opinion may prevail, but in truth the gopīs are more saintly than self-contented sages. The gopīs differ from sages whose minds flow like rivers into the ocean of samādhi, oblivious of names and forms. Though the gopīs forget everything material, including their own bodies, they never forget Kṛṣṇa's names, forms, and qualities. The lives of the gopīs are practical and real, full of variety, and imbued with the spirit of devotion to Kṛṣṇa. The gopīs, fixing their intelligence completely on Kṛṣṇa, never forget His names and forms. Thus they excel all munis by easily realizing the highest limit of happiness in full love of God.

In the Ninth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (9.4.64) Lord Nārāyaṇa tells the muni Durvāsā:

> nāham ātmānam āśāse<br/>
> mad-bhaktaiḥ sādhubhir vinā<br/>
> śriyaṁ ātyantikīṁ vāpi<br/>
> yeṣāṁ gatir ahaṁ parā<br/>

“O best of the brāhmaṇas, without saintly persons for whom I am the only destination, I do not desire to enjoy My transcendental bliss or even the association of My consort Śrī, the supreme goddess of fortune.” In other words, the Supreme Lord is more attracted to His pure devotees than to the goddess Śrī.

Here a doubt may arise: The gopīs of Vṛndāvana are also said to be goddesses of fortune. Doesn't that put them in the same category with Śrī? How then can they be considered Kṛṣṇa's dearmost devotees? Kṛṣṇa dispels this doubt here in His discussion with Uddhava in the Eleventh Canto by disclosing a confidential aspect of the gopīs' glories, an aspect that establishes the gopīs beyond all doubt as the greatest of saints, and greater even than the goddess Śrī. Earlier, in the Tenth Canto, while giving Uddhava the message to convey to the gopīs, Kṛṣṇa glorified them. But at that time Kṛṣṇa did not reveal that He Himself was distressed by being separated from them. Had He done so, Uddhava might have told this to the gopīs, and their condition would only have worsened. But now, in the Eleventh Canto, Kṛṣṇa wishes to refute the popular misconception that He is hard-hearted, and He wishes to satisfy Uddhava, and so, revealing the greatness of His own ecstasy, He discloses His feelings for the gopīs. In so doing, He describes how it is that the gopīs are more saintly than everyone else.

To understand the hidden meaning of what Kṛṣṇa is saying here, we have to read the word avidan as a present participle (“being unaware”) instead of a past-tense verb (“were unaware”). The rules of Sanskrit grammar allow this. As a participle, avidan is a masculine form in the subjective case, and so it must refer to the speaker, Kṛṣṇa Himself. Avidan can therefore be translated as “if I am unaware.” Kṛṣṇa's being the subject of the previous verse, which includes the word mayā (“by Me”), further justifies such a reading. The sages (munayaḥ) are another subject in the current verse, and thus, by extension, the participle can also refer to the sages.

Kṛṣṇa is saying, then, “Sages are not really sages if in their samādhi they become like rivers flowing into the ocean and forget My names and forms. Because the activities of their senses completely stop, such forgetful sages become as if dead, for they are devoid of the living soul's defining quality of thought and unable to experience transcendental ecstasy. In the same way, were I ever to forget My gopīs, were I ever to fail to think of them constantly, I would no longer be Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead.” Or, understanding this idea in an even more radical sense: “Then My life would come to an end; I would no longer exist.” Kṛṣṇa refrains from openly speaking this last thought, because He wants to spare Uddhava the pain of hearing something so distasteful.

Kṛṣṇa, divulging why He feels the way He does, says to Uddhava, “I am obliged to the gopīs because their minds are absolutely fixed on Me. The gopīs always think exclusively of Me, and their attraction to Me is most sublime. Therefore, dear brother, for them I have the greatest love. I must confess to not having the same kind of love for anything or anyone else—not for My parents, My brothers, My queens, My children, not for My own transcendental body, not for My Vaikuṇṭha abode with all its paraphernalia and associates, nor My special abodes here in Dvārakā and Mathurā. All of them I could forget and still be Myself, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and not feel as much pain as if I were ever to forget the gopīs of Vraja. I am always thinking of the gopīs with supreme love and attachment.”

In another verse, found in Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī's Padyāvalī (135), Uddhava tells the gopīs:

> viyoginīnām api paddhatiṁ vo<br/>
> no yogino gantum api kṣamante<br/>
> yad dhyeya-rūpasya parasya puṁso<br/>
> yūyaṁ gatā dhyeya-padaṁ durāpam<br/>

“The path you women traverse who feel separation from Kṛṣṇa, even great yogīs cannot approach. You have realized the goal of meditation that others can hardly achieve—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is the most worthy object of meditation.” Real yogīs, engaged in eternal devotional service to the Supreme Lord, know only Kṛṣṇa as the object of their meditation. But the gopīs have surpassed even such genuine yogīs because the gopīs are the constant object of Kṛṣṇa's meditation. Therefore they are greater than everyone else.

#### комментарий

The gopīs fulfilled their highest ambitions by achieving Kṛṣṇa as their lover. Those cowherd women were so exalted that by personal contact with them thousands of the outcaste women of Vraja—Pulindīs and other aborigines—achieved the same rarest goal of life. The word abalā (“women”) in its literal sense means “not strong,” indicating that the aborigine women lacked the assets of knowledge, good birth, good behavior, and devotion to God. They were ignorant of their own eternal identities as spirit souls, and because they had never come close enough to Nanda Mahārāja's village to see Kṛṣṇa with their own eyes, they were also ignorant of Kṛṣṇa's all-attractive beauty. Nonetheless, in the forest the aborigine women of Vraja accidentally came in contact with grass and leaves smeared with kuṅkuma from the bodies of the gopīs and in this way gained the transcendental association of the gopīs and also became infected with the desire to have Kṛṣṇa as their lover. Or if we presume that the Pulindīs and other aborigine women, simply by being born in Kṛṣṇa's holy dhāma, must have known that they were eternal souls, their association with the gopīs, even though indirect, infused them with sublime devotion for Kṛṣṇa and made them forget whatever spiritual knowledge they had. They were also ignorant of who they were in another sense: taking no heed of their own dirtiness and their dingy complexions, they were helplessly impelled toward Kṛṣṇa by the conjugal attraction they contracted from the gopīs.

The Pulindīs and others may have been low-class tribal women, but they had the greatest fortune of being attracted to the Supreme Absolute Truth, the darling son of Nanda Mahārāja. And that attraction was extraordinary. They accepted Him as the absolute master of their lives, and that too in the special mood that He was their unmarried lover. They had to keep their love for Kṛṣṇa secret because as outcastes they had little hope of ever meeting Him and if they did chance to meet Him that contact would be considered altogether illicit. Thus they privately cherished the treasure of prema within the cores of their hearts. At every moment they tasted newer and newer sweetness in the highest possible limits of blissful satisfaction. Having had some contact with the gopīs, the aborigine women of Vraja all attained a perfection similar to theirs, if not in this life then in the next.

#### комментарий

Texts 147 through 152 (Bhāgavatam 10.47.58–63) were spoken by Śrī Uddhava during his visit to Vṛndāvana. Because of his own solid reputation as an exalted Vaiṣṇava, his testimony that the devotional service of the gopīs is supreme is extremely credible. Uddhava is a favorite student of Bṛhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, and he is a trusted advisor to Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā. Kṛṣṇa Himself praises Uddhava with enthusiasm:

> athaitat paramaṁ guhyaṁ<br/>
> śṛṇvato yadu-nandana<br/>
> su-gopyam api vakṣyāmi<br/>
> tvaṁ me bhṛtyaḥ suhṛt sakhā<br/>

“My dear Uddhava, O beloved of the Yadu dynasty, because you are My servant, well-wisher, and friend, I shall now speak to you the most confidential knowledge. Please hear as I explain these great mysteries to you.” (Bhāgavatam 11.11.49)

> vāsudevo bhagavatāṁ<br/>
> tvaṁ tu bhāgavateṣv aham<br/>

“Among those entitled to the name Bhagavān I am Vāsudeva. And among the devotees, you indeed, Uddhava, represent Me.” (Bhāgavatam 11.16.29)

> na tathā me priya-tama<br/>
> ātma-yonir na śaṅkaraḥ<br/>
> na ca saṅkarṣaṇo na śrīr<br/>
> naivātmā ca yathā bhavān<br/>

“My dear Uddhava, neither Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa, nor the goddess of fortune, nor indeed My own self is as dear to Me as you.” (Bhāgavatam 11.14.15)

When Uddhava met with the gopīs in Vṛndāvana, he used all his diplomatic skill to deliver Kṛṣṇa's message in a way that would relieve the agony the gopīs felt in separation from Kṛṣṇa. But after hearing the message, the gopīs became even more deeply immersed in the ocean of their distress. Uddhava was astonished by the extraordinary intensity of the gopīs' attachment to Kṛṣṇa. He had never seen or even heard of such pure devotional surrender. Therefore, just before leaving Vṛndāvana, Uddhava spoke these six verses, in homage to the gopīs and their pure devotion for Kṛṣṇa.

Here, in the first of these verses, Uddhava declares the gopīs greater than all aspirants for liberation, greater than all self-realized liberated saints, and greater than all other devotees of the Personality of Godhead. Only the gopīs—the goddesses of fortune who reside in the cowherd village of Śrī Nanda—have realized the full potential of human life (tanu-bhṛto bhuvi). That these greatest of all Vaiṣṇavas are human beings and residents of earth is fitting because on higher planets like Svarga, the abode of Indra, the residents enjoy so much power and sense gratification that such love for Kṛṣṇa is practically impossible for them to achieve. In other words, the demigods and sages living in the higher regions of the universe can hardly ever perfect their lives like the gopīs of Vraja.

The words tanu-bhṛto bhuvi (“perfecting their lives on earth”) can also be understood in another way: By sharing the rare gift of prema-bhakti, the gopīs deliver the fallen conditioned souls of this earth. In other words, the devotional lives of the inhabitants of earth are nourished by the gopīs. The influence of the natural compassion and other virtues of the gopīs is supremely beneficial for everyone because the gopīs possess the greatest possible love for the inner Lord of all souls, the son of the king of the cowherds, the Lord who is famous as Govinda because He is “the Indra of the cows.” Moreover, the gopīs disregard everything else and love Govinda as the Lord of their hearts, their lover, their paramour. They enjoyed with Kṛṣṇa the unprecedented rāsa-līlā festival, and then, by displaying the all-attractive transformations of their viraha-bhāva, they deprived Uddhava of his wisdom by vanquishing his sobriety. For a long time the gopīs had quietly endured within their hearts the pain of separation from Kṛṣṇa; but after hearing Kṛṣṇa's message from Uddhava they could no longer hold themselves back. Uddhava then became a witness to the uncontrollable waves of their complete distress. The ecstasy the gopīs feel in separation from Kṛṣṇa makes the whole world cry in sympathy and brings Vaiṣṇavas to the verge of death.

In the obvious sense, Kṛṣṇa is nikhilātmā in that He is “the soul of all beings,” but in this verse the phrase nikhilātmani has another, confidential meaning. He is also nikhilātmā in that each gopī cherishes Him as her very life and soul (literally, “her entire self”), in a way that other devotees cannot imitate. No one loves Kṛṣṇa as unconditionally as do the gopīs.

Mumukṣus, renounced aspirants for liberation, fear material existence; and self-satisfied Vaiṣṇava devotees of the Lord, who are liberated souls (muktas), are free from such fear. And both, in their own ways, understand Kṛṣṇa to be the supreme goal and the supreme fruit of spiritual endeavors. The liberated Vaiṣṇavas and the aspirants for liberation who have the good fortune to get the mercy of those Vaiṣṇavas admire the love the gopīs have for Kṛṣṇa, but rarely do they attain it. Uddhava considers Himself to be in the same category—a sincere servant of Kṛṣṇa who can only admire the gopīs' prema from a distance.

But isn't Lord Brahmā, rather than the gopīs, the greatest of all Vaiṣṇavas? Since he is the original guru for the path of devotional service, isn't he superior to all aspirants for liberation and to all liberated devotees? He sits on the seat of highest sovereignty in this universe, and he is endowed with many excellences. If the gopīs are so exalted, then, why didn't they accept births like his, in which they would have been worshiped by the whole world, rather than come to the earth as lowly cowherd women? Uddhava answers these questions by saying kim brahma-janmabhir ananta-kathā-rasasya. The term ananta-kathā refers to topics about the unlimited Lords—Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Balarāma. Uddhava simply states that a rasika-bhakta, a person who has a taste for hearing ananta-kathā, sees no use in being born as Lord Brahmā, even numerous times. Such rasika-bhaktas regard birth as Brahmā as an obstacle to cultivating the taste for ananta-kathā because such a birth creates various distractions, such as pride. Therefore the gopīs, intent on tasting the honey found at Śrī Govinda's lotus feet, would rather be born as simple daughters of cowherds than as such an exalted being as Lord Brahmā.

Alternatively, the rules of Sanskrit grammar allow kathā-rasasya to be split as kathā-arasasya, meaning “for one who has no taste for hearing these topics.” If someone has no interest in ananta-kathā, what can he gain by taking birth as the creator of the universe? Nothing of real value. Attraction to ananta-kathā is the real fruit of renunciation, liberation, and devotional practice. Thus a person who lacks this taste cannot honestly be called a renunciant, a liberated sage, or a Vaiṣṇava.

Another way of looking at Uddhava's words is that he is explaining why the gopīs, though on the highest level of self-realization, chose to abandon the norms of civilized behavior, the principles of dharma taught in the Vedas. In this context, brahma-janma can be interpreted to mean “the appearance of Vedic knowledge within.” For the gopīs, or indeed for anyone who has a taste for the topics of the unlimited Lord, the presence of Vedic knowledge on the lips and in the heart is less important than attraction to kṛṣṇa-kathā.

Brahma can also be taken to signify “knowledge of the pure self,” and janma to signify “the means to generate this knowledge,” namely the Vedas. In other words, a person who has realized ananta-kathā-rasa has nothing to gain by Vedic study or theoretical knowledge that he is spirit distinct from matter. And to a person who has no ananta-kathā-rasa, of what use is Vedic study or knowledge of the self? Ananta-kathā-rasa is the only substantial result to be gained from studying the Vedas and inquiring into the identity of the self. Vedic study and self-realization are only means toward that final goal. Once one has reached the goal, one can put aside the means by which one got there, just as a person who has lit a lamp to find something in his room before going to sleep can put out the lamp and lie down to rest once he has found what he was looking for, or just as one who has paid to take a boat across a river can forget about the boat after crossing. And, conversely, when a person never attains the goal but remains stubbornly attached to the means, all he accomplishes is useless effort, as in beating empty husks of grain.

A devotee situated in ananta-kathā-rasa is therefore a superior person. Whether practicing the regulations of vaidhī-bhakti or helplessly submerged in the ocean of rasa, he can never give up hearing and chanting about Kṛṣṇa, and doing whatever promotes that hearing and chanting. What to speak, then, of the gopīs, those most fortunate of all women, who have the rarest quality of love for Śrī Govinda? For them, ordinary Vedic cultural standards and the dry realizations of selfish meditation are of no value whatsoever.

#### комментарий

It is obviously with irony that Uddhava speaks these words. He considers himself unqualified to have the company of the gopīs, which he has achieved only by the undeserved mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Contrasting himself with the gopīs, Uddhava thinks that they are Kṛṣṇa's dearmost devotees whereas he has deviated in so many ways from the path of devotion: he has committed serious aparādhas, refused to carry out Kṛṣṇa's instructions, and failed to develop confidence in the process of bhakti-yoga. According to him, compared to the gopīs he is especially fallen.

The gopīs are “roamers of the forest.” In other words, their intense love for Kṛṣṇa impels them to wander about the Vṛndāvana forest, where so many of His pastimes took place. And in the agony of separation from Kṛṣṇa they live in the most secluded part of the Vṛndāvana forest, where they wander about in the impassable wilderness. These transcendental goddesses of fortune in Śrī Nanda's cowherd community are now totally helpless under the sway of their incomparable prema.

Uddhava's life is nothing like that of the gopīs: He is male and lives in a bustling metropolis, where his residence is fixed; he enjoys all comforts and is therefore unfit to wander about the Vṛndāvana forest; he is proud of knowing philosophically who Kṛṣṇa is and so cannot gain the topmost treasure, the gopīs' love for Kṛṣṇa. Thus Uddhava judges himself a most fallen wretch compared with the gopīs, whose saintly qualities are inexhaustible. He thinks he will never deserve their association.

Uddhava refers to himself in the plural (duṣṭāḥ) either because of the honor he gained by the slight association he had with the gopīs in Vṛndāvana or else because he speaks on behalf of Śrī Nārada and Akrūra also. He does not refer to the gopīs directly but simply calls them “these women” (imāḥ), thus indicating the awe he feels in their presence. Certainly nowhere but in the hearts of the gopīs can such elevated pure love for Kṛṣṇa be seen. And certainly, Uddhava thinks, only by the special power of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa could such a foolish person as himself have had the privilege of witnessing the glories of the gopīs.

Kṛṣṇa is īśvara, the independent supreme controller, free to give suitable rewards for any service done for Him. He can reciprocate with His devotees however He wishes. He can shower His kindness even on an ignorant person who knows nothing of His greatness and the greatness of His servants, a person who sees devotees and devotional service with material vision but who somehow has rendered a little service to one of His devotees. If any person, by approaching Kṛṣṇa's devotee, takes even a slight step toward accepting service to Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa at once reciprocates with all kinds of assistance and blessings. Just as a powerful medicine is effective even on patients completely ignorant of its properties, the Lord's mercy acts on anyone who comes in touch with Him.

The word nanu (“certainly”) can alternatively be understood as two separate words, na (“not”) and nu (“indeed”). Indeed, because Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whatever He wants to do He can, and whatever He does not want to do He can refrain from. Or He can transform reality; in other words, He can undo any situation to change it to whatever He prefers. He has unlimited, all-powerful energies, by which He fulfills all His desires. Thus He can award the highest perfection of life to anyone—to the wise saint who worships Him constantly without deviation (anubhajataḥ), to someone who has worshiped Him irregularly (na anubhajataḥ), or even to someone who has never worshiped Him but has by some good fortune or other come in touch with His devotees. And if Kṛṣṇa wants, He can award this causeless mercy without delay (sākṣāc chreyas tanoti). He can make His mercy visible to all, not just a select few. He can make His mercy so obvious that one need not search for it by speculative philosophical conjectures. Kṛṣṇa's mercy thus acts like a rare, most potent medicine, effective even if not swallowed and digested but merely brought near the patient and smelled.

Uddhava is astonished that although Mahā-lakṣmī, the consort of Lord Nārāyaṇa, is famous as His beloved, she cannot enjoy the Supreme Lord's favor in the same way as the gopīs of Vraja. If the supreme goddess of fortune is less fortunate than these gopīs, what can be said of everyone else?

Oh, let me be so fortunate as to be one of the bushes, creepers, or herbs in Vṛndāvana, because the gopīs trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.**

#### комментарий

By observing the glories of the gopīs, by describing those glories in his own words, and by meeting the gopīs in person, Uddhava is now completely absorbed in the gopīs' special mood of loving Kṛṣṇa. In this exalted state, he has now discovered his true heart's desire, which in this verse he prays to achieve as the final fruit of all the service he has done for Kṛṣṇa. In his next life, he hopes to become any of the plants in Vṛndāvana who receive the dust from the gopīs' feet.

The enthusiasm Uddhava gains from expressing this wish inspires him to say more about the greatness of the gopīs. For the service of Śrī Mukunda's lotus feet, the gopīs have abandoned things impossible for young women to give up—husbands, children, and other relatives, and the Vedic standards of behavior. Casting aside everything ordinarily precious, they have chosen to devote themselves utterly to mukunda-padavīm, the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Or, understanding padavīm in its more literal sense of “footpath,” every day the gopīs eagerly go out, morning and evening, to watch the path Kṛṣṇa will use to go to the forest and return. Or else mukunda-padavīm is the spiritual path of bhakti-yoga. The gopīs have abandoned their families and religious principles just to engage in Kṛṣṇa's service, even without expecting to obtain Him. For such unique surrender, they should be acknowledged as supremely glorious.

But why have these gopīs, whose feet are worshiped by all respectable persons, set a bad example by abandoning the noble life of dedication to their husbands and fathers? Why have they defied the authority of the Vedas in that way? Uddhava answers that the Vedas themselves consider devotional service to Kṛṣṇa the most important goal in life and aspire for the service of Śrī Mukunda's lotus feet. The word vimṛgyām indicates that the Vedas can only strive to achieve the prema of the gopīs, not achieve it. Therefore, even though the Vedas are the teachers of all principles of religion and spiritual knowledge, it is perfectly fitting that the gopīs take no heed of Vedic authority and in fact abandon the Vedic principles for the sake of obtaining the most precious thing—something the Vedas themselves can hardly obtain. Indeed, for the gopīs to observe the religious principles upon which their families insist would only prevent the gopīs from properly worshiping the lotus feet of Mukunda.

On this matter, Lord Kṛṣṇa has given His own opinion:

> trai-guṇya-viṣayā vedā<br/>
> nistrai-guṇyo bhavārjuna<br/>

“The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to those three modes.” (Bhagavad-gītā 2.45) And here in Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta we have just read, in Text 147, Uddhava's own words from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.47.58), kiṁ brahma-janmabhir ananta-kathā-rasasya: “For one who has tasted the narrations of the infinite Lord, what is the use of taking birth as a high-class brāhmaṇa, or even as Lord Brahmā himself?” In other words, any real attraction to the topics of Lord Ananta exempts one from having to follow the Vedic injunctions that regulate thought and behavior. The gopīs, moreover, have earned this exemption even more certainly than have others because the only desire the gopīs have is to follow the path of their beloved Mukunda.

Alternatively, Uddhava's statement may be understood as his answer to another doubt. The Vedas, the śrutis, are the supreme object of reverence even for Brahmā and the other demigods, who receive their knowledge from the Vedas. This we hear from the very words of the śrutis themselves. How then are the gopīs justified in disregarding the Vedic instructions? In response to this query, Uddhava says that the scope of Vedic authority is limited to the field of ordinary religious life whereas the gopīs have completely transcended that jurisdiction by taking exclusive shelter of Kṛṣṇa. The Vedas can merely seek Kṛṣṇa, but the gopīs already possess Him. In the opinion of some authorities, the Upaniṣads earned the right to become gopīs out of intense hankering to worship Kṛṣṇa in the gopīs' special mode of prema. But this should be rejected as an untenable theory. Why? Because the Upaniṣads are inferior in devotion even to the goddess Lakṣmī. Thus the Upaniṣads, on their own merit, do not deserve the good fortune of becoming gopīs. Only on the strength of Kṛṣṇa's special mercy could any of them ever attain that perfection.

#### комментарий

Aren't all devotees of Kṛṣṇa equally glorious for renouncing their families and whatever else prevents them from approaching Kṛṣṇa? Yes, but the intimacy of the gopīs' surrender makes them special. Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet are worshiped by the goddess of fortune with all the opulence at her command; she serves her Lord's feet by massaging them, and she attends Him in various other ways. Brahmā, Rudra, Indra, and other demigods also worship Kṛṣṇa's feet, and so do the mahat-tattva and the other elements of creation; the demigods and the elements over which the demigods preside worship Kṛṣṇa's feet by performing Vedic sacrifices and carrying out His orders. Self-satisfied liberated sages also worship with devotion those same feet, aiming at them as the supreme goal of life. The great masters of bhakti-yoga worship His lotus feet within their purified hearts by hearing and chanting Kṛṣṇa's glories with pure love. But the worship performed by all these elevated souls (with the exception of the goddess Lakṣmī) is for the most part only mental; rarely does Kṛṣṇa grant His darśana to these demigods, sages, and devotees. The gopīs' worship of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet is much more intimate.

The words kṛṣṇasya tad bhagavataḥ indicate this intimacy. The pronoun tat (“that”) implies that even before the rāsa dance the gopīs were already intimately familiar with the supreme beauty of Kṛṣṇa's feet. And after Kṛṣṇa left the gopīs at the very beginning of the rāsa-līlā, they spent some time vividly remembering those very feet in the ecstasy of separation. Though these were the same lotus feet worshiped by Śrī, the goddess of fortune, the gopīs realized them in a special way, as the feet of the darling young son of Yaśodā and Nanda. The lotus feet the gopīs repeatedly held to their breasts during the rāsa dance were thus the most excellent embodiment of all beauty. By holding Kṛṣṇa's feet in this way, the gopīs were completely relieved of the pain of separation. Certainly, then, the gopīs are the greatest devotees, because they worshiped Kṛṣṇa's feet not merely by meditating on them but by holding them physically in their embrace. Because the feet they worshiped were the feet of the Supreme Lord in the form of Kṛṣṇa, the gopīs are superior to the demigods, headed by Brahmā. Because the gopīs touched those feet directly, the gopīs are superior to the self-satisfied sages. Because the gopīs held those feet to their breasts, the gopīs are superior to the masters of yoga. And because the association of the gopīs with Kṛṣṇa occurred during the rāsa-līlā, the gopīs are superior even to Mahā-lakṣmī.

As Uddhava describes how the gopīs, during the rāsa dance, obtained relief from the distress of separation, he harbors the concern that the feelings of separation the gopīs suffer now are much more serious. Now that Kṛṣṇa has left them to go to Mathurā, Uddhava doubts whether even a skillfully delivered message from Kṛṣṇa can do much to console them. Although Uddhava has done his best, the effect will most likely be negligible. But in any case, he himself has been deeply affected by his meeting with the gopīs. He has imbibed the spirit of their special prema, and in that mood he has prayed to take birth in Vraja in any form of life, be it a bush or other plant, that may be touched by the dust of the gopīs' divine feet. Because Uddhava could properly value and learn from the love of the gopīs, it was him Kṛṣṇa chose to carry the message to Vṛndāvana.

Like Uddhava, Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī took to his own heart the gopīs' mood of devotion to Kṛṣṇa. At the end of the Tenth Canto, Śrīla Śukadeva expresses this mood when he praises Kṛṣṇa's Dvārakā queens:

> yāḥ samparyacaran premṇā<br/>
> pāda-saṁvāhanādibhiḥ<br/>
> jagad-guruṁ bhartṛ-buddhyā<br/>
> tāsāṁ kim varṇyate tapaḥ<br/>

“How could one possibly describe the great austerities performed by these women who perfectly served Him, the spiritual master of the universe, in pure ecstatic love? Thinking of Him as their husband, they rendered such intimate services as massaging His feet.” (Bhāgavatam 10.90.27) Even though Śrīla Śukadeva, while speaking this verse, uses the term bhartṛ (“husband”) rather than jāra (“paramour”), he is actually thinking of the gopīs of Vraja and burning in the fire of their ecstasy. But he dares not mention this, out of fear that in ecstasy he would lose his self-control.

Even in modern times, and even among men, there are great devotees who are known to have attained pure love for Kṛṣṇa in the mood of the gopīs. No one should doubt this, thinking that for male devotees the mood of the gopīs is incompatible. Anyone well versed in the epics and Purāṇas will know the example of the austere sages of the Daṇḍaka forest. When the sages saw the beauty of Śrī Raghunātha (Lord Rāmacandra), they became attracted in the conjugal mood and wanted to enjoy having Him as their husband. In the Uttara-khaṇḍa of Śrī Padma Purāṇa, Lord Śiva, speaking to his wife Pārvatī, describes that history:

> dṛṣṭvā rāmaṁ hariṁ tatrabhoktum<br/>
> aicchan su-vigraham<br/>
> te sarve strītvam āpannāḥ<br/>
> samudbhūtāś ca gokule<br/>
> hariḥ samprāpya kāmena<br/>
> tato muktā bhavārṇavāt<br/>

“When they saw Lord Hari in the beautiful form of Rāmacandra, they at once wanted to enjoy Him. Thus they all took birth as women in Gokula and, by their lusty attraction to Lord Hari, obtained Him as their husband. In this way they gained liberation from the ocean of material existence.”

The Kūrma Mahā-purāṇa also states:

> agni-putrā mahātmānas<br/>
> tapasā strītvam āpire<br/>
> bhartāraṁ ca jagad-yoniṁ<br/>
> vāsudevam ajaṁ vibhum<br/>

“By performing austerities, the wise sons of Agni took birth as women and obtained as their husband Lord Vāsudeva, the unborn and unlimited source of creation.”

#### комментарий

After thus taking great satisfaction from sweetly singing the glories of the gopīs, Uddhava falls flat on the ground, on the very path their lotus feet have touched. Picking up a speck of dust from the path, he places it on his head as if it were the rarest treasure in the universe. And after offering again his prostrate obeisance, he recites this final prayer.

Uddhava is absorbed in ecstasy, so much so that even though he can see the gopīs, he speaks and offers homage to them with deep reverence as if they were not present. Obviously, he feels sublime pleasure in chanting their glories. The most ecstatic kind of saṅkīrtana, however, is that chanted by the gopīs themselves; their loud songs purify all the worlds, including the upper, lower, and middle planetary systems. Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī has described this earlier in his narration of Uddhava's visit to Vṛndāvana:

> udgāyatīnām aravinda-locanaṁ<br/>
> vrajāṅganānāṁ divam aspṛśad dhvaniḥ<br/>
> dadhnaś ca nirmanthana-śabda-miśrito<br/>
> nirasyate yena diśām amaṅgalam<br/>

“As the ladies of Vraja loudly sang the glories of lotus-eyed Kṛṣṇa, their songs blended with the sound of their churning, ascended to the sky, and dissipated everything inauspicious in every direction.” (Bhāgavatam 10.46.46)

Uddhava also implies that any suitable praise of the gopīs, such as the prayers he has just sung, is in fact the most excellent form of hari-kathā. Such glorification can easily purify the three worlds, as Uddhava hoped to do by speaking these verses.

#### комментарий

Now that Parīkṣit Mahārāja has sung the praises of the young gopīs of Vraja, he turns his attention to the most excellent of those gopīs, the blessed Śrī Rādhā, whose ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa is so deep that mere words cannot do it justice. King Parīkṣit remembers how Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī constantly hankers to drink the nectar of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's lips, so much so that when She hears Kṛṣṇa's flute-song from a distance as He enters the Vṛndāvana forest She imagines the flute to be tasting that nectar as it touches His lips. Thinking like that, She begins to envy the flute as if it were a rival lover. As her girlfriends stand and talk about Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhādevī then interjects this comment of Her own (Bhāgavatam 10.21.9), which Parīkṣit Mahārāja now chooses to recite.

Śrī Rādhā, addressing Her friends, headed by Lalitā, asks what good deeds this flute, this lifeless piece of wood, could have done to earn the blessing of enjoying the nectar from Kṛṣṇa's lips? If She could find out what the flute has done, the gopīs could also do it and obtain the same favor. After all, the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's lips belongs to them, not the flute. Śrī Rādhikā doesn't specifically say that the nectar is “theirs to enjoy,” but says only that the nectar is “theirs,” because She feels too shy to speak so explicitly. The flute may have the right to rest in the hand of his master, Dāmodara, or be held to Dāmodara's chest or even His lips, but when that flute dares drink as much as he likes of the intoxicating nectar of Kṛṣṇa's lips, that flute is being too bold. Because Śrī Rādhā and Her friends are members of the cowherd community and therefore have a close relationship with Kṛṣṇa, they can claim ownership of the nectar from Kṛṣṇa's lips. The flute is an outsider. If he continues the audacity of drinking this nectar, the gopīs will have to steal him and take him to some secret place for safekeeping. Otherwise the flute will take all the nectar himself, leaving only the remnants of its fragrance for the gopīs.

The rivers are like the flute's mothers because their milklike water enabled the flute to grow to his present size. When the rivers contemplate the success of their son, the groves of lotuses growing in their waters bloom, like hair on their bodies standing jubilantly erect. And the bamboo trees in whose family the flute was born are so proud of him that they shed a downpour of ecstatic tears in the form of sweet sap. Their skin erupts in goose bumps, and they cry profusely, like venerable elders of a clan who see one of their children become a servant of the Personality of Godhead.

The phrase avaśiṣṭa-rasam has several possible meanings. One is that the flute enjoys all the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's lips, leaving not a drop for anyone else. Another is that as much as the flute drinks, his thirst (rasa or rāga) remains unquenched, and being frustrated he cannot stop drinking more and more. A third meaning is that the gopīs, having rejected all material tastes (rasa) and having thus lost all interest in sense gratification in this life and the next, are attracted only to the taste of the nectar from Kṛṣṇa's lips—and the flute, knowing this well, still deprives them of that nectar by drinking it himself.

A more complex explanation of avaśiṣṭa-rasam may be understood as follows. How fortunate this flute must be! The Yamunā and the other rivers of Vraja, who purify all the worlds by providing arrangements for bathing and other auspicious activities, are satisfied to partake of the mere remnants of nectar that Kṛṣṇa's flute has left behind as dry pulp. Connoisseurs of devotional poetry know very well how the rivers of Vraja, during the water sports enjoyed by Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs, obtain some of the nectar from Kṛṣṇa's lips (adharāmṛta). Or perhaps only one of the rivers, Śrī Kālindī-devī (Yamunā), is allowed to drink that adharāmṛta directly, and the other rivers in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma receive remnants from her, an opportunity they have earned by residing in the abode of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. After tasting even the smallest drop of the nectar that remains, all the rivers feel transcendental bliss, and their bodily hairs stand on end. And since the rivers become ecstatic just to have a drop of that nectar, how pious must be Kṛṣṇa's flute to be able to drink as much as he wants.

By providing shade and fruits for everyone, the pippala and other trees on the banks of Vraja's rivers are like the elders of a noble family who perform auspicious service for others. Those trees cry unhappy tears because they cannot receive the nectar from Kṛṣṇa's lips. We may wonder why the trees cannot share this nectar or may doubt whether trees should be crying in disappointment when they don't receive it. After all, a beggar may be sorry to have nothing to eat, but he shouldn't lament that he can't rule a kingdom. This doubt is dispelled by knowledge that the trees of Vraja are Āryans, great saints. As exalted devotees of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the trees are moved to tears by sadness when they don't obtain Kṛṣṇa's adharāmṛta, even though they have no right to claim it. Or, taking another meaning of the word āryāḥ, the ones crying in frustration are the mothers-in-law and other respectable elders of Śrī Rādhā.

#### комментарий

Śrī Parīkṣit Mahārāja recited several verses of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam to glorify, generally and specifically, the residents of Gokula. Now, to conclude properly and invoke auspiciousness, he glorifies the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead by again repeating the words of his own spiritual master, Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Just as Agastya Ṛṣi drank from his palm the entire salt ocean, the divine Śukadeva spoke this verse in an effort to drink from his own palm the entire ocean of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's pastimes described in the Bhāgavatam's Tenth Canto. Śrīla Śukadeva places this verse (10.90.48) near the very end of the canto as a complete synopsis of the pastimes discussed in several thousand verses. The verse that immediately precedes this in the Bhāgavatam mentioned Kṛṣṇa explicitly, and Kṛṣṇa's glories are the focus of this part of Śukadeva's narrative. Thus even though the present verse does not mention Kṛṣṇa by name, it is obviously about Him. Just as Parīkṣit Mahārāja sang the praises of different Vraja-vāsīs in order of their relative importance, Śukadeva here tells of six special aspects of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's superexcellence, in order of increasing importance.

First, Kṛṣṇa is the nivāsa—the residence, shelter, and foundation—of all living beings. He also resides as the Supersoul within their hearts. And He is manifest externally, especially among His janas, or favorite devotees, in the forms of His numerous incarnations. Thus He is the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Ātmā, the Lord of all, the seed of all avatāras.

Second, Kṛṣṇa displayed the extreme limit of His manifold opulence in the respectful words He spoke to His father and mother at the time of His birth, when He described the reason for His birth as their son and His desire to be carried to Gokula. By this unprecedented revelation of the purpose of His descent, He proved Himself the most generous bestower of benedictions and the most compassionate protector of His parents. And by ordering Vasudeva to carry Him to Gokula, Kṛṣṇa showed His intention to distribute far and wide the most precious treasure of prema.

Third, by having the most excellent Yadus as His companions and servants, Kṛṣṇa further demonstrates the supreme opulence of His appearance. As Śrī Yādavendra, Kṛṣṇa puts to an end the distress of His dear servants the Yadus and secures their happiness by killing wicked enemies of their clan, like Kaṁsa and Jarāsandha. Thus He shows His absolute concern for His devotees. The phrase yadu-vara-pariṣat indicates that Kṛṣṇa is served by the exalted members of the Yadu dynasty. Or, since the word pariṣat carries the meaning “assembly,” we can understand the phrase to mean that Kṛṣṇa brought down to the earth the Sudharmā assembly hall of the demigods, making it the court of the king of the Yadus, Ugrasena. The Sudharmā hall is but one of many treasures of heaven, including the pārijāta tree, that Kṛṣṇa brought to the earth. Thus Kṛṣṇa, by defeating the demigods on several occasions, displayed His supreme power and opulence. And by giving the royal assembly hall to Ugrasena, the father of His archenemy Kaṁsa, the Lord displayed His causeless unequaled kindness.

Fourth, although Kṛṣṇa could have effortlessly done away with the causes of irreligion simply by using His supreme will, to create pleasurable pastimes for His devotees He killed the demonic opponents of religion by using His mighty arms, arms long, well developed, beautifully shaped, adorned with armlets and other ornaments, and bearing weapons like His Sudarśana disc. As described in Śrī Hari-vaṁśa's narration of Kṛṣṇa's battle with Bāṇāsura, when fighting such enemies Kṛṣṇa would sometimes, for the special delight of select devotees, manifest four arms instead of two. Therefore Śukadeva uses the plural form dorbhiḥ instead of the dual form dorbhyām, which is normally used to indicate only two arms. Or, understanding the word “arms” another way, devotees who assisted Kṛṣṇa, such as the Pāṇḍavas, acted as His arms. Kṛṣṇa used these kṣatriyas, originally born from His arms, to kill envious enemies and uproot the power of irreligion. Of course, Kṛṣṇa by His mere desire could have killed Jarāsandha and all the other wicked kings who opposed Him, but out of fatherly compassion He chose to share His fame with His devotees.

Fifth, while enjoying His pastimes in Gokula, Kṛṣṇa expanded the fullness of His loving devotional service. Although the pastimes Kṛṣṇa performed in Mathurā and Dvārakā occurred after His pastimes in Gokula, here they are mentioned in inverse order because Kṛṣṇa's excellences are most completely manifest in Gokula. Kṛṣṇa generously bestowed His prema-bhakti on all the residents of Vṛndāvana, including even the nonmoving beings, such as creepers, bushes, and trees, what to speak of the moving creatures, down to even the insects and microbes. Disregarding their lack of qualifications, He gave them the gift of loving devotion to Himself, which automatically destroys all the troubles of material existence.

Or, from another angle, just as the happiness available in heaven is an impediment for those who want liberation, the happiness of liberation is an impediment for those who want loving devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. That distressful obstacle—that so-called happiness—Kṛṣṇa effortlessly destroys for all the devotees spontaneously attracted to Him in Vṛndāvana and elsewhere in Vraja-bhūmi. Simply by expanding His prema-bhakti throughout Vraja-bhūmi, Kṛṣṇa delivers the moving and nonmoving residents of Vraja from the miseries of both material entanglement and impersonal liberation. Indeed, when Kṛṣṇa expanded the flood of love of God in Vraja, all moving and nonmoving living beings in the three worlds were relieved of the unhappiness of material existence. Just as a fire lit for the sake of cooking also dispels cold and darkness, the spread of kṛṣṇa-bhakti automatically freed all living beings from material miseries as a secondary result. In fact, when Kṛṣṇa descended to Gokula on earth, He freed all His devotees throughout the universe from attraction to liberation, which they may obtain as easily as yogīs obtain wonderful siddhis. This freedom was an automatic byproduct of the unalloyed prema displayed in Vraja-bhūmi. But even though all devotees in the universe were thus freed, the devotees living in Vraja during Kṛṣṇa's pastimes gained the fullest relief from the dangers of liberation and material entanglement.

Finally, sixth, Kṛṣṇa most fully reveals His greatest glories—His fascinating beauty, charm, and cleverness—in His pastimes with the young gopīs of Vraja. During Kṛṣṇa's presence Vraja-bhūmi becomes like an opulent city (pura), bustling with Kṛṣṇa's many different pastimes and romantic dalliances. Kṛṣṇa's lovely smiling face, decorated by His flute and various ornaments, enchants the women living in Vraja. The god of love, Kāmadeva, is called deva because he is brilliantly radiant (dīvyati). The beauty of Kṛṣṇa's face gives Kāmadeva unlimited power over the gopīs, a power that conquers the attractions of material life and transcends even the attraction of liberation.

Cupid is famous for spoiling the self-interests of everyone he influences, but for the gopīs of Vraja Cupid destroys the bonds of material existence. He helps the gopīs bring Śrī Kṛṣṇa under their control and assumes for them the forms of mukti and bhakti. Thus Cupid arranges for the gopīs to realize Kṛṣṇa in His full glory and enjoy His company as ever fresh at every moment.

Attraction to Kṛṣṇa in the mood of the gopīs may itself be called kāma-deva—the god of all love—because the most excellent form of desire is that which focuses unconditionally on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only such single-pointed desire evolves into the most exalted state of pure love.

The word deva also indicates the idea of play. Taken in that sense, it indicates that in pastimes of intimate enjoyment the beauty of Kṛṣṇa's face expands the play of Cupid among the gopīs. The beauty of Kṛṣṇa's face has a powerful effect on the gopīs, much to His delight. It makes them forget the four goals of life and raises them to the highest level of pure prema, which is the mature fruit of all devotional endeavors. In this way, Kṛṣṇa's smiling face represents the ultimate greatness of the Supreme Person—the magnificence of His charm, His beauty, and His expertise in loving affairs.

It is not without reason that Śukadeva Gosvāmī uses the word vardhayan (“increasing”) in the present tense. It expresses the fact that Kṛṣṇa's pastimes go on eternally in Vraja-bhūmi. In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.44.13) the women of Mathurā also use the present tense to describe Kṛṣṇa's sporting in Vṛndāvana even after He has moved to Mathurā. Vikrīḍayāñcati giritra-ramārcitāṅghriḥ: “He whose feet are worshiped by Lord Śiva and the goddess Ramā is wandering about in Vṛndāvana, enacting His many pastimes.” The fact of Kṛṣṇa's eternal presence in Vṛndāvana is upheld by many statements of scripture and by the personal experience of many unalloyed devotees. As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.1.28), mathurā bhagavān yatra nityaṁ sannihito hariḥ: “Mathurā is very intimately connected with Kṛṣṇa, for Lord Kṛṣṇa lives there eternally.”

The word pura suggests the city of Mathurā. And indeed Kṛṣṇa increases the influence of Cupid for both the women of Vraja and the women of Mathurā City. But the mention of the city more confidentially implies that when Kṛṣṇa goes away to Mathurā the gopīs become immersed in the agony of separation. It is then that they achieve the highest limit of prema, and therefore Śrīla Śukadeva, even while glorifying Kṛṣṇa's sports with the gopīs in Gokula, has alluded to His going to Mathurā.

In summary, the same Supersoul who resides in the hearts of all living beings took up residence in the womb of Devakī. As the Supersoul He is only the passive indwelling supervisor, but as the son of Devakī He speaks and reciprocates with her in many loving ways. The mighty heroes of the Yādava dynasty are the Supreme Lord's servants, and they are able to defeat all the forces of evil. Still, the Lord chooses to use His own two arms to kill opposing kings. He also destroys the sins and miseries of all moving and nonmoving creatures. But with the gopīs He acts in a seemingly contrary way. Although they are married to other men, He incites in them the influence of Cupid and becomes their paramour. Thus He only increases their shame and misery. The gopīs themselves are not at fault in this, because it is the beauty of Kṛṣṇa's face that causes their predicament.

By thus presenting so many alternative understandings, Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī proves beyond any doubt the superexcellence of Kṛṣṇa and His wonderful qualities, such as His compassionate concern for His devotees.

Śrī Jaimini is also very much satisfied to hear his disciple's words, filled as they are with the pure spirit of prema. From what Janamejaya has said, Śrī Jaimini can discern that this disciple has properly assimilated what he has heard. Thus Jaimini answers him affectionately, calling him tāta (“my dear boy”).

Janamejaya was correct to say that now his life was successful, because he had listened carefully to Jaimini's narrative about the glories of Goloka. Simply by hearing or chanting this narrative with devotion, or thinking about it deeply, anyone can achieve that most inaccessible of divine abodes. And if one engages seriously in the regulative practice meant for attaining Goloka, then certainly one will achieve success.

Jaimini is confident, therefore, that the disciple has now fulfilled his goal in life by having heard these glories, and that he himself has fulfilled his own goal by having recited them. The auspicious fruits of hearing and chanting this narrative have thus been definitely assured.

#### перевод

**Obeisances to Him, the son of the blessed king of the cowherds, who is always astir with causeless compassion, who on His own initiative impels His servant to develop devotion for Him, and who then becomes fully satisfied, as if His devotee were being very kind to Him.**

#### комментарий

Coming to the end of his narration, Śrī Jaimini Ṛṣi remembers the supreme kindness of the Personality of Godhead and offers at His feet this entire effort. Nirupādhi-kṛpākulāya can be understood in two ways: Kṛṣṇa is full of many different kinds of causeless compassion (kṛpā-kula), or Kṛṣṇa, without any selfish motive, is always keen to do something beneficial (kṛpā-ākula). Śrī Jaimini calls Kṛṣṇa “the son of the king of the cowherds” either out of great respect or out of shyness. Since Jainimi now shares the mood of the gopīs, he is shy to mention Nanda Mahārāja, a respectable elder, by name.

Kṛṣṇa is the best of all spiritual instructors. Both internally as the Supersoul and externally as a Vaiṣṇava spiritual master, He bestows knowledge and everything else required for advancing on the path of devotional service. As Uddhava described to Kṛṣṇa in the Eleventh Canto (Bhāgavatam 11.29.6):

> naivopayanty apacitiṁ kavayas taveśa<br/>
> brahmāyuṣāpi kṛtam ṛddha-mudaḥ smarantaḥ<br/>
> yo 'ntar bahis tanu-bhṛtām aśubhaṁ vidhunvann<br/>
> ācārya-caitya-vapuṣā sva-gatiṁ vyanakti<br/>
> <br/>

“O my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual science would not be able to fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahmā, for You appear in two features—externally as the ācārya and internally as the Supersoul—to deliver the embodied living being by directing him how to come to You.”

Whatever Jaimini has spoken to Janamejaya, therefore, has been inspired by Kṛṣṇa, either directly or on the strength of instructions imparted by Kṛṣṇa's representative, the spiritual master. Thus it is fitting for Jaimini to offer the fruits of his labor to Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Soul. Because Kṛṣṇa is the most compassionate friend of all living beings and is their original spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa, without regard for spiritual qualifications and abilities, tries to engage everyone in devotional service to Him. He tries to engage all the senses of everyone in devotional practices, beginning with hearing and chanting of His glories. And when He sees some positive response from a conditioned soul, Kṛṣṇa becomes extremely pleased. He then showers all favors on the candidate for His service. The gratitude is mutual: Just as people in general are satisfied with someone who significantly helps them, all of Kṛṣṇa's devotees are ever thankful to the Lord; and when Kṛṣṇa sees His devotees practicing devotional service, He considers them His most gracious benefactors.

To end the Dig-darśinī commentary on Śrī Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī offers this prayer:

> svayaṁ pravartitaiḥ kṛtsnair<br/>
> mamaital-likhana-śramaiḥ<br/>
> śrīmac-caitanya-rūpo 'sau<br/>
> bhagavān prīyatāṁ sadā<br/>

“May the Supreme Lord in His form of Śrī Caitanya, who personally made me take up the labor of this writing, be always pleased.” The Lord renowned by the name Caitanya is śrīmān, the possessor of all divine opulences. He is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself appearing as the son of Śacīdevī. Or śrīmac-caitanya-rūpa can refer to the most fortunate servant of Lord Caitanya, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. Describing Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī as bhagavān is appropriate according to this definition of the term:

> āyatiṁ niyatiṁ caiva<br/>
> bhūtānām āgatāgatim<br/>
> vetti vidyām avidyāṁ ca<br/>
> sa vācyo bhagavān iti<br/>

“One is called bhagavān who knows the future and fortune, the birth and rebirth, the ignorance and enlightenment, of all beings.” Thus, both to the Lord and to that best of Vaiṣṇavas, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrīla Sanātana offers His respects.

Thus ends the Seventh Chapter of Part Three of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī's Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta, entitled “Jagad-ānanda: The Bliss of the Worlds.”
