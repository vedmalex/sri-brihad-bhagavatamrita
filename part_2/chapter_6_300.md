#### перевод

**The Yādavas have no shelter but You. All in great distress, their eyes fixed upon the path for my return, they are burning in a fire of lamentation. They all live in terror of Kaṁsa, and so also do the demigods, brāhmaṇas, and other exalted persons. Don't deprive them of hope.**

#### комментарий

Vasudeva and Devakī are not the only ones suffering with no hope of relief but Kṛṣṇa. So too are all the members of the Yadu clan. Related to Him both by family ties and by devotion, they look only to Him for their salvation. They are already in great anxiety because Akrūra has not yet returned to Mathurā with Kṛṣṇa, and if Akrūra returns without Him they will be devastated. By the very nature of the Yadus' pure love for Kṛṣṇa they are mahārtāḥ, greatly distressed, and śokottaptāḥ, burned by sorrow; now, on top of that, they should not be hatāśāḥ, deprived of their last hope. And besides the Yādava princes, yet others depending on Kṛṣṇa to save them from Kaṁsa's terror include demigods like Indra, learned brāhmaṇas like Garga, and all the cows and Vaiṣṇavas.

#### перевод

**Kaṁsa, the subduer of demigods, always brags about the strength of his own arms. He has no regard for anyone. He is constantly worshiped by demons like himself—some impotent, some very powerful—and by the rulers of men.**

#### комментарий

When Kṛṣṇa fails to respond, Akrūra tries to change Kṛṣṇa's mood from compassion to anger. In the beginning of Akrūra's statement, he refers to Kaṁsa merely as “he” (saḥ); in other words, so numerous and abominable are Kaṁsa's bad qualities that his name is not to be mentioned. His many demon friends in Mathurā help increase his influence, and they share his arrogance and other bad qualities. Powerful demonic rulers of other kingdoms like Bāṇa and Bhauma also support him.

#### перевод

**Śrī Sarūpa said: Akrūra, having said this, took blades of grass between his teeth and cried plaintively again and again. Then that person named “Uncruel,” who had a most brutal duty to perform, offered his obeisances to all the women of Vraja, one by one.**

#### комментарий

When Kṛṣṇa still didn't come out from the grove, Akrūra, knowing Kṛṣṇa to be controlled by His dearest devotees, appealed to the gopīs. He approached them with all the humility he could muster. This wasn't easy because, despite Akrūra's name, taking Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā was the cruelest thing anyone could do to them.

**Śrīmān Akrūra said: Don't be death for the descendants of the Yadu dynasty, and for all the people of the world. Please have mercy on them. Dear goddesses, Kṛṣṇa's wretched parents are imprisoned by Kaṁsa. Please help rescue them.**

#### комментарий

Everyone was afraid of Kaṁsa, including the cowherds of Vraja. Were Kṛṣṇa not to come soon to Mathurā, the lives of many innocent persons would be at risk, and the first to be killed might well be Vasudeva and Devakī. Therefore the gopīs should be merciful by consenting to Kṛṣṇa's departure and giving their blessings for an auspicious journey.

#### перевод

**The divine gopīs said: You great cheat, you speaker of falsehoods, you follower of Kaṁsa! How can those you speak of be Kṛṣṇa's parents? These two boys are the sons of Nanda and Yaśodā! Don't murder Gokula. Do not become a killer of women.**

#### комментарий

Why do the gopīs call the son of Śvaphalka Muni a great cheat and liar? Because he is a follower of Kaṁsa. The gopīs' statement that Vasudeva and Devakī cannot be Kṛṣṇa's parents is correct in the sense that Vasudeva and Devakī are really His unalloyed devotees acting as His parents, roles they accept only for His service.

By telling Akrūra not to kill the people of Gokula, and especially not to become a killer of women, the gopīs mean to say that his immediate concern should not be over Vasudeva and Devakī. The threat of their being killed lies in the future, and enough time remains for measures to prevent such a tragedy. The threat, however, that Akrūra will become the direct cause of the deaths of the inhabitants of Gokula, including the cows and women, is imminent. Akrūra should therefore think twice before committing these terrible sins.

_śrī-sarūpaḥ uvāca_ - Śrī Sarūpa said;

_niśamya_ - hearing;
_ceṣṭitam_ - about the activity;

#### перевод

**Śrī Sarūpa said: When Kṛṣṇa heard of wicked Kaṁsa's deeds, when He heard of the misery He Himself had caused His own relatives, and when He saw that Balarāma agreed with Akrūra, He apologized to the gopīs, and showing anger and sadness He left the grove.**

#### комментарий

The anger Kṛṣṇa felt was directed solely at Kaṁsa, and the sorrow He felt was for His faultless devotees. He interpreted His elder brother's silence as a sign that Lord Balarāma accepted Akrūra's proposal to take Them to Madhupurī.

#### перевод

**When the gopīs understood that Kṛṣṇa was about to leave for the city, they fixed their eyes on His lotus face. In dread of the imminent fire of separation, they cried and spoke to Kṛṣṇa, falling at His lotus feet.**

#### комментарий

For the gopīs to address Kṛṣṇa so boldly in public might have appeared audacious, but they were afraid of burning up in the fire of separation. And besides, the gopīs are not the only devotees who sometimes frankly express their agony to Kṛṣṇa in the presence of others. For example, in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.23.29) we hear from the wives of the Vedic brāhmaṇas:

> maivaṁ vibho 'rhati bhavān gadituṁ nṛ-śaṁsaṁ<br/>
> satyaṁ kuruṣva nigamaṁ tava pāda-mūlam<br/>
> prāptā vayaṁ tulasi-dāma padāvasṛṣṭaṁ<br/>
> keśair nivoḍhum atilaṅghya samasta-bandhūn<br/>

“O almighty one, please do not speak such cruel words. Rather, You should fulfill Your promise that You always reciprocate with Your devotees in kind. Now that we have attained Your lotus feet, we simply wish to remain here in the forest so we may carry upon our heads the garlands of tulasī leaves that fall from Your lotus feet. We are ready to give up all material relationships.”

#### комментарий

The gopīs are sure that if Kṛṣṇa refuses to accept their prayer they will very soon die. After all, didn't Kṛṣṇa turn their lives upside down? The forests were their homes because in the forests they enjoyed Kṛṣṇa's company. And their homes were like an empty wilderness because Kṛṣṇa wasn't there. Their rivals for Kṛṣṇa's affection were actually friends because with the help of those friends they were able to meet Kṛṣṇa. And by preventing the gopīs from going to Kṛṣṇa, their husbands and children acted as enemies. In fact the gopīs' love for Kṛṣṇa was so potent that it even transformed poisonous substances into the most palatable nectar. And for gopīs eager to die in the torment of separation, poison became attractive. Nectarean things like moonlight, sandalwood paste, and nice food were like poison for the gopīs because the gratification afforded by such things impeded their association with Kṛṣṇa, and when they were suffering separation from Him their so-called pleasures became unbearable. Śrī Nārada has already explained to Gopa-kumāra why pure love for Kṛṣṇa affected the gopīs in these strange ways.

**How could we not die a slow death if we could no longer see anywhere Your beautiful smiling face, Your all-attractive lotus feet, and Your chest, adorned by all splendor?**

#### комментарий

When Kṛṣṇa was getting ready to leave for Mathurā, He suggested to the gopīs, “I am going to Mathurā to satisfy My well-wishers there, who have no goal in life but Me. Until I return, you can keep yourselves happy by hearing, chanting, and remembering My glories.” This is the gopis' answer. If for any length of time the gopīs cannot see Kṛṣṇa's face anywhere (kuto 'pi)—either in His home or in the forest—they will surely die. Kṛṣṇa might also try to excuse Himself by saying that if because of Him His friends in Mathurā remain unhappy His reputation will be ruined. But (with kuto 'pi construed as “for whatever reason”) the gopīs would respond, “We do not care what reason You have. If You leave us we will die a slow death.”

#### комментарий

Only for at best a few hours can the gopīs tolerate the pain they feel from Kṛṣṇa's absence. If ever an evening were to pass without His coming home from the forest, their lives would be finished.

#### комментарий

Kṛṣṇa might assert that in the big city He will be able to take care of Himself with the same power He showed when He subdued Kāliya—but still He is bound to feel homesick. The gopīs cannot bear to think of Kṛṣṇa suffering in any way.

#### комментарий

Kṛṣṇa might argue that because His dear cows, His young friends, and His father will accompany Him to Mathurā He will not become too homesick. So here the gopīs give other reasons for their distress. Conceding that to kill Kaṁsa and many other demons would be mere play for Kṛṣṇa, the desires of all His devotees in Mathurā will take a long time to satisfy. And if Kṛṣṇa were to insist that because of remembering His dear girlfriends He could not stay away very long, the gopīs would answer: “No, we are not so confident You will even remember us.”

#### комментарий

It is hardly for sightseeing that Nanda is eager to take Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā. Though Mathurā is the home of intimate friends like Vasudeva and may be a great city, the real reason Nanda is going is that Kaṁsa ordered him. And this is hardly a cause for delight. Mathurā may be the home of the Yadus, but as long as it is ruled by Kaṁsa it will be a disagreeable place to visit.

Akrūra's assertion that Kṛṣṇa is the son of Vasudeva is a lie. As far as Nanda is concerned, Kṛṣṇa could never transfer His affection to anyone else. Even if Vasudeva and the Yadus were to try to keep Kṛṣṇa in Mathurā by force, Nanda would never return to Vṛndāvana without Him. And even if Kṛṣṇa, after killing Kaṁsa, were to be crowned king and want to stay in Mathurā to enjoy the kingdom, Nanda would never allow that to happen.
