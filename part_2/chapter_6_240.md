#### перевод

**When Kṛṣṇa's companions, the cowherd boys, saw that for no good reason He was gone, they all became as if struck down by death. In great anxiety to find Him they followed His footprints to the lake.**

#### комментарий

At first the cowherd boys had no idea where Kṛṣṇa might have gone, and they didn't know what to do. But soon they noticed footprints leading out of the village. Those footprints could not have been those of anyone but Kṛṣṇa because they had special marks, such as a flag and an elephant goad.

#### перевод

**These many young friends were the same boys who, losing sight of Krsna on the forest paths for but a moment, would lose their will to live. And now when they saw Him motionless they all fainted.**

#### комментарий

The footprints led the boys to the lake, but there they saw Kṛṣṇa immobilized, enwrapped in the serpent's coils. When Kṛṣṇa and the boys had been on excursions in the forest and Kṛṣṇa had passed for even a moment behind a tree and the boys couldn't see Him, the boys would lose all enthusiasm for living. And now to see Kāliya about to kill Kṛṣṇa filled them with dread.

#### комментарий

All creatures, including the birds and plants, agonized over Kṛṣṇa's predicament. They were all on the verge of death. The earth trembled, amidst other portentous omens:

> atha vraje mahotpātās<br/>
> tri-vidhā hy ati-dāruṇāḥ<br/>
> utpetur bhuvi divy ātmany<br/>
> āsanna-bhaya-śaṁsinaḥ<br/>

“In the Vṛndāvana area there then arose all three types of fearful omens—those on the earth, those in the sky, and those in the bodies of living creatures—which announced imminent danger.” (Bhāgavatam 10.16.12)

#### перевод

**Inspired by Lord Kṛṣṇa from within, one old man went running to the cowherd village. He wept and made dreadful cries of “Alas! Alas!” and told the cowherds what was happening.**

#### комментарий

Śrī Nanda and the other cowherds, having seen the bad omens and received no news about Kṛṣṇa, were about to die from anxiety. To relieve their suffering, Kṛṣṇa telepathically inspired an old cowherd to go tell them of the situation. Had Kṛṣṇa not ordered him in that way, the old man would not have had the strength to run back to Vraja. Kṛṣṇa is prabhu, the Lord, so He can empower anyone to do anything. He made an old person His messenger because an elder's words are less likely to interfere with anyone's intimate rasa and more likely to be trusted.

Actually the desperation the Vraja-vāsīs felt over seeing evil omens and having no news about Kṛṣṇa was designed to increase their special love for Him. Surely they would come quickly to Kāliya's lake when they learned He was there.

#### перевод

**The people of the cowherd village had already noticed many frightening omens. Kṛṣṇa was the source of Vraja's good fortune, and the cowherds, frantic with concern for Him, had already started out to seek Him.**

#### комментарий

The Vraja-vāsīs knew that as long as Kṛṣṇa was safe nothing bad would ever happen. The evil portents might therefore indicate that Kṛṣṇa was in great danger. With this terrible thought in mind, they all went at once to look for Him. They were already outside the village when the old messenger met them.

#### перевод

**The added force of the old man's report, spoken with a voice choking in his throat, struck them suddenly like a lightning bolt.**

#### комментарий

The shock of hearing that Kāliya had returned and was again holding Kṛṣṇa in his coils was unbearable.

_amilat_ - He met up;

#### перевод

**Balarāma somehow told His Mother Rohiṇī of the news, got her to stay back to watch the house, and ran to catch up with those who had left.**

#### комментарий

Knowing the power of His younger brother Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma couldn't believe that Kāliya had defeated Him. Balarāma came out of the house and ran into the street spontaneously shouting, “This can't be true!” Seeing the Vraja-vāsīs hurrying on their way to join the search for Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma tried to calm them. And He had to speak to His mother before He left. So He was one of the last to arrive on the scene.

It had taken all of Lord Balarāma's mental strength to convince His mother to stay home, and now it took all His physical strength to restrain Nanda and Yaśodā.

**Śrī Baladeva said: These are not the attendants who live with You in Vaikuṇṭha. They are not the forest monkeys. They are not the Yādavas. These are Your devotees of Goloka, who have no life other than You. They are dying, My Lord, and there is nothing I can do to save them.**

#### комментарий

Here Balarāma reminds Kṛṣṇa that the Goloka devotees are different from Kṛṣṇa's other eternal associates—His Vaikuṇṭha pārṣadas, His monkey soldiers of Ayodhyā like Hanumān, and the Yadus of Dvārakā like Uddhava. More than all these other devotees, the Goloka-vāsīs are exclusively dependent on Kṛṣṇa. The Lord's devotees in Vaikuṇṭha, Ayodhyā, and Dvārakā, being always aware of Kṛṣṇa's omnipotence, manage to tolerate separation from Him, and so they could have responded favorably to Balarāma's consoling words. But the hearts of these Goloka-vāsīs, under the intolerable weight of their prema, have lost all equilibrium. The Goloka-vāsīs cannot accurately estimate Kṛṣṇa's power, so they are convinced that Kāliya is about to finish Him. If Kṛṣṇa Himself does not act soon to relieve them, surely they will die.

**O merciful Kṛṣṇa, please give up this game before these devotees die! Otherwise, O Kṛṣṇa, sole friend of the cowherds, Your gentle heart will come to grief.**

#### комментарий

Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all rasas, and so He feels pathos (karuṇa-rasa). But although He enjoys the sport of pretending to be lifeless, His devotees are driven to desperation by it. If He doesn't stop this sport, He will be the last one to lament—when all His devotees have died. Lord Balarāma is playing on Kṛṣṇa's emotions because He knows that Kṛṣṇa cannot tolerate seeing His devotees suffer.

#### перевод

**Śrī Sarūpa said: The gopīs cried and lamented in so many ways, their limbs in terrible pain, their hearts shattered by sorrow. They fainted and fainted. And as if to go to the side of their Lord, they tried to enter the lake.**

#### комментарий

On the way to the lake, the gopīs repeatedly fainted at the mere thought of Kṛṣṇa's distress, and so they arrived last. Their hair was scattered, and their broken bangles and other ornaments scratched their arms. They tried to enter the lake “as if” to join Kṛṣṇa, but their real purpose was to drown themselves.

Someone might question, “How could these gopīs, who are worshiped by the wisest scholars in creation, be so ignorant of the Supreme Lord's power?” The answer is that their minds were distracted by sorrow. It is unreasonable to think that the exalted gopīs cannot suffer sorrow; in fact, they simply cannot bear to be apart from Kṛṣṇa, even for a moment.

#### перевод

**Suddenly the Lord stopped His self-invented sport and freed Himself from the grip of Kāliya's coils. He climbed up on the serpent's thousands of upraised, outspread hoods and extended His lotus arms.**

#### комментарий

To save the gopīs from despair, Kṛṣṇa extracted Himself from the clutches of Kāliya's embrace before the girls could reach the water. He jumped up onto Kāliya's uncountable hoods and spread His arms to lift the gopīs up to be with Him, even though the gopīs were out of arm's reach. He is prabhu and so can do anything He wants. He is never restricted by the laws of nature.

**Kṛṣṇa artfully danced with the gopīs on those most amazing stages, accompanied by many celestial singers and musicians. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa, the source of all amusement, enjoyed His rāsa dance pastime.**

#### комментарий

Never before had anyone seen such stages for dancing as these. To complement the festivities, many demigods appeared in the sky overhead, singing and playing musical instruments. In this atmosphere Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs fully enjoyed their dancing. The entire spectacle was created by the energies of Kṛṣṇa, who is kautukārṇava (“the source of all entertainment”). Śrī Nanda and the other older cowherds, slow to recover from their deep shock, did not witness this rāsa dance.

#### комментарий

Having to carry Kṛṣṇa like a horse is hardly a degrading punishment. Only rare souls like Garuḍa can have the honor of being the Supreme Lord's carriers. As the Nāga-patnīs stated in their prayers to Kṛṣṇa in the Tenth Canto (10.16.34):

> anugraho 'yaṁ bhavataḥ kṛto hi no<br/>
> daṇḍo 'satāṁ te khalu kalmaṣāpahaḥ<br/>
> yad dandaśūkatvam amuṣya dehinaḥ<br/>
> krodho 'pi te 'nugraha eva sammataḥ<br/>

“What You have done here is actually mercy for us, since the punishment You give to the wicked certainly drives away all their contamination. Indeed, because this conditioned soul, our husband, is so sinful that he has assumed the body of a serpent, Your anger toward him is obviously to be understood as Your mercy.”

When the Nāga-patnīs presented ornaments to Kṛṣṇa, He did not immediately put them on His own body. First He placed them on Kāliya's hoods, and then, while He and the gopīs were all still standing on the hoods, He decorated the gopīs and Himself.

**Together with the troupe of young cowherd girls, most amazing Kṛṣṇa dismounted Kāliya. The serpent was filled with happiness, for he had obtained great favors and benedictions difficult for even Garuḍa to achieve.**

#### комментарий

Kāliya had good reason to be satisfied, for his heads had been graced by the presence of Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs. And Kṛṣṇa offered him other benedictions, including the boon that Kāliya's hoods would always bear the auspicious marks of Kṛṣṇa's feet. Kṛṣṇa is the most amazing person because He shows such kindness even to wicked creatures like Kāliya.
