> gamanāgamanair bhedo<br/>
> yaḥ prasajjeta kevalam<br/>
> taṁ cāhaṁ tat-tad-āsaktyā<br/>

#### перевод

**Traveling from one to the other, back and forth, may make it seem that there is some distinction, but I am so attached to both places that I hardly notice any difference.**

#### комментарий

Śrī Sarūpa perceives a distance as he moves from the middle of the material universe to the topmost limit of the spiritual sky, but to him this distraction is insignificant. The journey is no more troublesome than the walk a farmer has to take to a field near his home.

### 2.6.376

#### санскрит

**Neither my sight, nor my hearing, nor even my mind ever touches any other abode than these two.**

#### комментарий

Being exclusively attached to Kṛṣṇa and His abodes, Śrī Sarūpa is oblivious to everything else.

### 2.6.377

#### санскрит

> anyatra vartate kvāpi<br/>
> śrī-kṛṣṇo bhagavān svayam<br/>

#### перевод

**My heart never thinks that the original Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, or His devotees like those present here, could ever reside anywhere else.**

#### комментарий

Here Sarūpa is talking only about svayaṁ bhagavān, the original Personality of Godhead, and His Vraja devotees, not about the Lord's expansions, like Vāsudeva in Dvārakā, and Their devotees like Vasudeva.

### 2.6.378

#### санскрит

> kadācid darśanaṁ vā syād<br/>

_paśyāmi_ - I see;
_tān_ - them;
_api_ - indeed;

#### перевод

**From time to time I may see residents of Vaikuṇṭha or some other place, but to my eyes they appear tormented by separation from Śrī Kṛṣṇa.**

#### комментарий

Śrī Sarūpa's vision is that of a paramahaṁsa situated in vraja-bhāva, the mood of Vraja. He sees everyone, even outsiders, as if they were also in that mood. When he meets devotees from Dvārakā, Ayodhyā, and Vaikuṇṭha, he projects his own feelings onto them and presumes that they are anguished by not being with Kṛṣṇa in Vraja. In this way, nothing distracts Sarūpa from his meditation on the glories of Goloka, and he remains satisfied in all circumstances.

### 2.6.379

#### санскрит

> kadāpi teṣu vraja-vāsi-loka-<br/>
> sādṛśya-bhāvānavalokanān me<br/>

_prakāśāt_ - due to the manifestation;
_paramam_ - utmost;
_sukham_ - happiness;
_tat_ - that;

#### перевод

**By not seeing in those other devotees a mood like that of the residents of Vraja, I may occasionally be disappointed. Yet that only makes my love for Kṛṣṇa shine forth more brightly. And so my disappointment becomes a cause of supreme joy.**

#### комментарий

Because the devotees of all the expansions of Godhead are eternally blissful, Sarūpa sometimes notices that even outside Vraja, even without Kṛṣṇa's direct company, such devotees are happy. That anyone could think himself happy without being in the mood of Vraja disturbs Sarūpa occasionally, but that very agitation impels His love for Kṛṣṇa in Goloka to increase. He can thus remain happy even while passing through Vaikuṇṭha or the material world.

### 2.6.380

> aho golokīyair nikhila-bhuvanāvāsi-mahitaiḥ<br/>
> sadā tais tair lokaiḥ samanubhavanīyasya mahataḥ<br/>

_namaḥ_ - obeisances;

#### перевод

**How much can I say about that supreme reality—oh, the world of Goloka! Its multitude of residents, honored by all the worlds, always perceive its greatness. So now I have said enough. To all who live with the Lord in that abode, I offer my obeisances.**

#### комментарий

Goloka is the ultimate reality, and the essence of that reality is pure love for the lotus feet of Śrī Nanda-nandana. Hearing about and describing the wonderful sports of Kṛṣṇa in Goloka and in Mathurā Gokula on earth are the most worthwhile engagements for anyone. Ultimately, however, one can only say so much, and one must finish by simply offering one's respects to the most fortunate inhabitants of Lord Kṛṣṇa's abode. By honoring them one honors their pure love for Kṛṣṇa, a love which is the highest goal of all endeavors.

Thus ends the Sixth Chapter of Part Two of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī's Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta, entitled “Abhīṣṭa-lābha: The Attainment of All Desires.”
