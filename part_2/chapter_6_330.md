#### комментарий

Akrūra had practical intelligence acquired from many years of service to the Vṛṣṇi rulers. Now that he was finally on the way to Mathurā with Kṛṣṇa, he did everything in his power to assure that nothing would go wrong. He made a show of holding Kṛṣṇa to protect Him from falling, but the fact was that he wanted to prevent Kṛṣṇa from again running off.

#### комментарий

Akrūra hoped that being at Brahma-hrada, better known as Akrūra-tīrtha, would remind Kṛṣṇa of how Kṛṣṇa had given the cowherds a vision of Vaikuṇṭha. And that memory might further remind Kṛṣṇa of one of the purposes for which He had descended to the earth—to kill Kaṁsa.

### 2.6.323

#### санскрит

**The Yadus, who had no goal in life but Kṛṣṇa, had suffered greatly and were terrified of the kings favored by Kaṁsa. Out of concern for those Yadus, the Lord, always compassionate to His devotees, stayed with them with His elder brother. And to comfort His devotees in Gokula, He sent back Nanda and the other cowherd men.**

#### комментарий

Kṛṣṇa is bhakta-vatsala. He feels obliged to take care of anyone who takes exclusive shelter of Him. Because Kaṁsa hated the Yadus, they suffered terrible persecution under his rule. Now Kaṁsa was dead, but Jarāsandha and other powerful friends of Kaṁsa were still alive and could attack Mathurā at any moment.

### 2.6.329

#### перевод

**“Father,” the Lord said, “first you should quickly go home with the cowherds, before any of Gokula's residents die in our absence.**

#### комментарий

Kṛṣṇa cleverly argued that if Nanda Mahārāja were to return home, the Vraja-vāsīs might be pacified enough to at least stay alive.

### 2.6.330

**The Vraja-vāsīs and Your mother still live and breathe only because I gave them hope. If I were to turn so hardhearted as to go back without You, O father, surely they would die on the spot.**

#### комментарий

All the people of Vraja trusted Nanda when he gave his word that he would not come back without Kṛṣṇa. To violate that word would be to sentence them all to death. Desperate to change Kṛṣṇa's mind, Nanda tries to reawaken Kṛṣṇa's family sentiments and the memory of His poor mother and curiously reverses roles with Kṛṣṇa by calling Him father.

#### комментарий

As the Dharma-śāstras prescribe, sons of vaiśyas at the age of eleven should undergo the upanayana-saṁskāra (acceptance of the sacred thread by initiation). Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa, Vasudeva suggests, are not exceptions. They too should be sent to the gurukula of a learned brāhmaṇa to study the Vedas. They should stay neither in Mathurā nor at home in Vṛndāvana with their parents. But until the upanayana ceremony is arranged, Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa can safely stay with Vasudeva while They finish Their business in Mathurā.

#### комментарий

Only because Nanda was confident that Kṛṣṇa couldn't stay away from home without His father was Nanda willing to leave; surely Kṛṣṇa would decide at the last minute to come back with him to Vraja.

#### комментарий

It seemed that Nanda was right; Kṛṣṇa wanted to go home with him. But the Yādavas implored Kṛṣṇa not to go, arguing that He was needed in Mathurā to save them from great catastrophes, not least of which was the threat of invasion by Jarāsandha. And they persisted in putting forward their reasons until Kṛṣṇa agreed to stay.

#### перевод

**Obeying Kṛṣṇa's desire, Nanda and the other cowherd men went back to Vraja. And when the Vraja-vāsīs heard that he had arrived, they all came out to greet him, full of joy.**

#### комментарий

Only because Kṛṣṇa asked the cowherds to return did they take the unimaginable step of going home without Him. Kṛṣṇa's desire was the only force that could move them to do such a thing. Even the carts went down the road by their own force, without being driven, by Kṛṣṇa's desire. The devotees that had stayed in Vraja also lived only according to Kṛṣṇa's desire; naturally, then, they assumed that Kṛṣṇa was with Nanda, and they greeted Nanda joyfully.

#### комментарий

Bereft of Kṛṣṇa, Nanda had good reason to feel sorrowful and, having broken his promise not to return without Kṛṣṇa, good reason to feel ashamed.

#### комментарий

Since no one told the Vraja-vāsīs that Kaṁsa was dead, they were still afraid of what he might do to Kṛṣṇa. Nanda was silent about what had happened to Kṛṣṇa in Mathurā, and they feared what they might be told if they were to ask.
