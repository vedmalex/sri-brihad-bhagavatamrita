#### комментарий

Kṛṣṇa's command is recorded in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (10.16.60–61):

> nātra stheyaṁ tvayā sarpa<br/>
> samudraṁ yāhi mā ciram<br/>
> sva-jñāty-apatya-dārāḍhyo<br/>
> go-nṛbhir bhujyate nadī<br/>

“O serpent, you may not remain here any longer. Go back to the ocean immediately, accompanied by your retinue of children, wives, other relatives, and friends. Let this river be enjoyed by the cows and humans.

#### комментарий

The pastime of subduing Kāliya involved the combined rasas of pathos and heroism, but the next pastime recounted is one of pure heroism (vīra-rasa). In this instance the two famous demons Keśī and Ariṣṭa, friends of Kaṁsa, arrived in Vraja at the same time. Assuming animal bodies, abnormally large, they terrified the cowherd village and harassed the cows, trampling them with heavy feet. Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī says the demons harassed gokula. He uses this word to mean both “the cowherd village” and “the herds of cows.”

#### перевод

**Though Kṛṣṇa's frightened loved ones tried to stop Kṛṣṇa, pulling Him back with all their might, Kṛṣṇa reassured them. Showing the courage of a hero, He slapped His arm with His hand and went forward to confront the demons.**

#### комментарий

Frightened by this monstrous horse and bull, the men and women of the cowherd community wanted to prevent Kṛṣṇa from going near the demons.

#### комментарий

Since horses generally travel faster than bulls, Kṛṣṇa first encountered Keśī. Kṛṣṇa kicked the horse demon so far away that he was unlikely ever to come back. Kṛṣṇa then subdued Ariṣṭa and offered him to Śrī Gopīśvara, the famous śiva-liṅga of the Vṛndāvana forest, to remain sitting before Gopīśvara Mahādeva, tied up for safekeeping as Lord Gopīśvara's carrier, so that Ariṣṭa would not be free to wander about and cause more trouble.

**Then Keśī the horse returned, but powerful Kṛṣṇa, whose valor never falters, jumped up and forcibly mounted him. Training him to move here and there, Kṛṣṇa splendidly displayed His own prowess by taming Keśī completely.**

#### комментарий

How could Kṛṣṇa have brought Ariṣṭa to Gopīśvara and then returned so quickly to meet Keśī? Kṛṣṇa is amanda-vikrama, anything but slow. His abilities have no limit.

### 2.6.261

#### перевод

**One day while Kṛṣṇa was living in the town of Nandīśvara, Akrūra came, on Kaṁsa's order, to take Kṛṣṇa from Vraja to Madhu-purī.**

#### комментарий

The next pastime, described in texts 263 through 344, is one of pure extreme pathos (karuṇa-rasa). Both in Goloka and in the earthly Gokula, Nandīśvara Hill is the site of Nanda Mahārāja's residence. The Vṛndāvana pastimes thus far related by Śrī Sarūpa happened mostly in the forests, but on this occasion Kṛṣṇa was at home in Nanda-grāma.

### 2.6.264

**If stones, logs, and other inert objects, even from other places, hear what happened then in Vraja, they cry and shatter to pieces.**

#### комментарий

We have already been told about the exceptional ecstatic symptoms of the trees and rocks of Vṛndāvana, but now we are informed that such objects even outside Kṛṣṇa's abode are devastated when they hear the pastime of Akrūra's taking Kṛṣṇa away from Vraja.

#### перевод

**Yaśodā, her son her very life, was terrified of wicked Kaṁsa. Hiding herself and hiding Kṛṣṇa by keeping Him covered with her cloth, she uttered special vows for His protection.**

#### комментарий

Mother Yaśodā was aware of how difficult it would be to keep Kṛṣṇa hidden. Her only hope was to recite magic incantations.

Akrūra reminded Nanda how wicked Kaṁsa was, yet assured Nanda that Kṛṣṇa was fully capable of dealing with the evil king. Nanda had no choice but to let Kṛṣṇa go to the aid of their friends in Mathurā.

#### комментарий

By sending Kṛṣṇa away, Nanda Mahārāja was taking away the gopīs' very life. But when Nanda personally escorted Kṛṣṇa out of the house to the waiting Akrūra, there was nothing the gopīs could do but stare incredulously.

### 2.6.269

#### комментарий

In the civil law discussed in the Manu-saṁhitā and other Dharma-śāstras, nyāsa or nikṣepa is a major topic. When a person deposits property with someone for safekeeping, the person holding the property is held gravely responsible. Anyone found guilty of betraying this trust—for example, by failing to return the property to its legitimate owner—the government should punish severely.

#### перевод

**She then told Nanda, “I place in your hand this son, more dear to me than life and wealth. Don't trust anyone. Just bring Him back here to my side and return Him to my hand.”**

#### комментарий

In her own oblique way, Yaśodā advises her husband not to place too much trust in Akrūra.

Seeing Kṛṣṇa about to leave, the women of Vraja now lost all hope.

#### перевод

**Simple-hearted Yaśodā told the ladies of Vraja all sorts of things, trying to console them. But their minds were immersed in a vast ocean of pain and sorrow, and so they answered her with anger:**

#### комментарий

Yaśodā suggested to the ladies that because she had turned her son Kṛṣṇa over to Akrūra, the son of a muni, and to Nanda Mahārāja, there was no reason to worry about Him. One can assume that anything left on deposit with a saintly person is safe. “I am sure that Akrūra will come back soon with my husband to return Kṛṣṇa to me.” She was too simple-hearted to question Akrūra's promise, even though she knew he could be duplicitous.

#### перевод

**“O merciless woman, devoid of sense! Just see—you have offered your own calf into the hands of a tiger. This empty house is fit to burn down. How can you enter it alone?”**

#### комментарий

Even a less intelligent animal like a cow would never willingly allow a tiger to take away her calf. How then could Yaśodā have offered her son to Kaṁsa's servant? And after doing so, how could she have returned alone to a home devoid of Kṛṣṇa's presence?

**Lord Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa's older brother, the divine son of Rohiṇī and Vasudeva, then went with His uncle Akrūra to search for Kṛṣṇa. By certain signs He was able to locate the grove.**

#### комментарий

Like Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma is also called Vāsudeva, because He is a son of Vasudeva by another wife. Akrūra used Lord Balarāma's inability to tolerate Vasudeva's suffering as leverage to secure Balarāma's help in finding Kṛṣṇa. Once Balarāma agreed to bring Kṛṣṇa back, it was easy to spot Kṛṣṇa's footprints and follow them to the place where Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs had gone.

**Śrīmān Akrūra said: Evil Kaṁsa unceasingly harasses Your old parents. Sword held high, he is ready to kill them. Surely You should not neglect them, Your devotees, so burdened by fear, by sorrow, by pain.**

#### комментарий

Akrūra is trying to impress upon Kṛṣṇa that Kṛṣṇa should not neglect the plight of His helpless elderly parents. There is every chance that Kaṁsa will kill them. They are terrified of Kaṁsa, and sorrowful because they cannot see their son, and pained by Kaṁsa's slander of Kṛṣṇa. And there is no time to delay; even if Kaṁsa does not murder them, their own distress might kill them.
