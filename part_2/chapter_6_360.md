The Mathurā brāhmaṇa, just to bring his guru back to external consciousness, called out to him, touched his feet, and sprinkled him with water.

#### комментарий

Because Sarūpa's disciple the brāhmaṇa had a strong desire to hear, Sarūpa, even at the cost of his own well-being, felt the compassionate duty to help him spiritually advance.

#### комментарий

According to the advice of Uddhava and other dependable counselors, only Kṛṣṇa's return would calm the Vraja-vāsīs. Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma therefore exchanged Their royal garments for Their old cowherd dress and went home.

#### комментарий

Kṛṣṇa made sure that the Vraja-vāsīs forgot every last thought that had caused them anguish, including Akrūra's having come to Vraja and taken Him away to Mathurā. Kṛṣṇa took this trouble for two reasons: because He is vidagdha-mūrdhanya-maṇiḥ, the most gracious performer of valorous deeds, and because He is kṛpākula, driven by compassion for His suffering devotees.

#### комментарий

Even in their dreams, the Vraja-vāsīs couldn't imagine Kṛṣṇa leaving them to go elsewhere. Their panic at the mere thought of it was but another aspect of their ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa.

#### комментарий

On the order of Kaṁsa, the same Akrūra came again to bring Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā. Because everyone, including Akrūra, was bewildered by the influence of the Goloka atmosphere, no one could remember that this was not the first time Akrūra had arrived in Vṛndāvana.

#### перевод

**Kṛṣṇa subdues Kāliya time and again, in the same way, and time and again lifts Govardhana Hill. And again and yet again He performs His many other wonderful pastimes. Thus the Lord enchants the hearts of His devotees.**

#### комментарий

Since all of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, beginning with the killing of Pūtanā, are eternal, Kṛṣṇa enjoys them with His devotees in Goloka as often as they like. Yet each time a pastime is repeated, it seems completely new, as if never seen or heard of before. This description may confuse us. How can Kṛṣṇa replay pastimes He has already performed, and how can demons like Pūtanā repeatedly be killed? But Kṛṣṇa's pastimes are transcendental. They are unlimitedly attractive to all His devotees, whether eternal companions or new converts to pure devotional service. Even newly elevated devotees feel extraordinary love for the Supreme Person whenever they hear and remember His pastimes. Those pastimes generate such a force of loving attraction as to fix the memories of them in the hearts of the devotees. Meditation on those pastimes then gives rise to a very special happiness. In this way Kṛṣṇa's pastimes steal the hearts of even neophyte devotees, and Kṛṣṇa's eternal devotees taste a sweetness and wonder unknown to anyone else.

#### перевод

**But the residents of Vraja, completely bewildered by the kālakūṭa poison of their supreme love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, never think that any of these events has ever occurred before.**

#### комментарий

Because the Vraja-vāsīs are never aware that Kṛṣṇa's pastimes are repeat performances, the attraction they feel for those pastimes is never impeded. The highest states of kṛṣṇa-prema have the power to create such bewilderment.

### 2.6.358

#### санскрит

_vārtā_ - topic;

_tatra_ - there (in Vraja);
_nitya_ - eternal;

_mādṛśām_ - like me;
_api_ - even;

#### перевод

**As true as this is for the eternal residents of Vraja, even newcomers like me can hardly remember those past events.**

#### комментарий

In pure devotional life everyone is fully absorbed in transcendence. Some devotees, however, can be distinguished as nūtna (“new”) because they were conditioned souls and have recently been reinstated in their original position by devotional practice and the Supreme Lord's personal grace.

#### перевод

**And, oh, the most glorious thing is that the foremost of enlightened persons, the Lord Himself, while drowning in an ocean of love for His dear devotees, cannot always remember what He has done and what He is going to do.**

#### комментарий

Isn't perfect knowledge an automatic byproduct of love of God? Why then are the pure devotees of Goloka so forgetful? Yes, to one who has prema omniscience comes naturally, but prema, being all-powerful, can redefine what is knowledge and what is ignorance. The Personality of Godhead Himself, by the influence of His Yogamāyā, also forgets what He did before. But though He often forgets, He sometimes remembers, if it serves the purpose of His pastimes.

#### перевод

**The pastimes of the Lord are ever existing and purely spiritual, formed of eternity, knowledge, and bliss. Of their own accord, those pastimes, attracted to the Lord's lotus feet to engage in service, follow Him everywhere, supplying the entourage and paraphernalia for each occasion.**

#### комментарий

Kṛṣṇa's pastimes are sac-cid-ānanda-mayī, composed of sat (“eternal existence”), cit (“full awareness”), and ānanda (“pure ecstasy”). In this context the suffix -mayī could mean either “identity” or “transformation.” In other words, since Kṛṣṇa's līlās are a display of Kṛṣṇa's internal energy, they are nondifferent from Him, and they are also a manifestation of transcendental variety.

There are never any defects in Kṛṣṇa's līlās, even when Kṛṣṇa seems to behave like an ordinary person:

> evaṁ dhārṣṭyāny uśati kurute mehanādīni vāstau<br/>
> steyopāyair viracita-kṛtiḥ su-pratīko yathāste<br/>
> itthaṁ strībhiḥ sa-bhaya-nayana-śrī-mukhālokinībhir<br/>
> vyākhyātārthā prahasita-mukhī na hy upālabdhum aicchat<br/>

“[The ladies of the neighborhood complained to Yaśodā:] 'When Kṛṣṇa is caught in His naughty activities, the master of the house will say to Him, “Oh, You are a thief!” and artificially express anger at Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa will then reply, “I am not a thief. You are a thief!” Sometimes, being angry, Kṛṣṇa passes urine and stool in a neat, clean place in our houses. But now, our dear friend Yaśodā, this expert thief is sitting before you like a very good boy.' Sometimes all the gopīs would look at Kṛṣṇa sitting there, His eyes fearful so that His mother would not chastise Him, and when they saw Kṛṣṇa's beautiful face, instead of continuing to complain about Him they would simply look upon His face and enjoy transcendental bliss. Mother Yaśodā would mildly smile at all this fun, and she would not want to chastise her blessed transcendental child.” (Bhāgavatam 10.8.31)

To Kṛṣṇa's feet His pastimes are attracted by their own desire to serve Him, and they are attracted by the service attitude of His devotees. In the words of Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa (5.22.18):

> manuṣya-dehināṁ ceṣṭām<br/>
> ity evam anuvartataḥ<br/>
> līlā jagat-pates tasya<br/>
> chandataḥ sampravartate<br/>
> <br/>

“The pastimes of the Lord of the universe unfold by their sweet will, as He imitates the activities of living beings embodied as humans.”

For a very long time, Gopa-kumāra had harbored the desire to see Śrī Gopāladeva and join Him in His pastimes. Now Gopa-kumāra has finally reached his destination, Goloka Vṛndāvana, but Kṛṣṇa has left Vṛndāvana to go to Mathurā. Under the circumstances, how can Gopa-kumāra tolerate living in Vraja? And since he is attached to the countryside where Kṛṣṇa performed His childhood pastimes, how can he consider living in Mathurā?

#### перевод

**Śrī Sarūpa said: By the order of the Lord, I and all devotees like me continue to live in Vraja in the company of Nanda and the others whose moods resemble ours.**

#### комментарий

When Kṛṣṇa left Vraja, He gave special instructions to the new devotees who had come to His abode on the strength of His mercy and their spontaneous (rāgānuga) sādhana. He told them to remain in Vraja and continue to associate with great devotees like Nanda, whose ways of devotion were similar to their own. Otherwise, if the new devotees were to go to Mathurā, the incompatible local mood would disturb them, and their spiritual development would be impeded. With such considerations in mind, Śrī Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya (2.13) states:

> sva-kulardhyai tato dhīmān<br/>
> sva-yūthān eva saṁśrayet<br/>
> <br/>

“If an intelligent person wants to see his family prosper, he should stay with his own kind.”

#### комментарий

In Goloka the apparent misery of separation from Kṛṣṇa is in fact the greatest happiness, and the anxiety felt by the Goloka-vāsīs is more ecstatic than any other pleasure. As already explained, both these contrary effects are due to the unique nature of the special love for Kṛṣṇa found only in Goloka.

#### комментарий

Knowledge of Goloka applies equally to Gokula, and vice versa, because these two places are identical. Just as a jñānī's realization of impersonal Brahman includes realization of the individual spirit soul, realization of either Goloka or Gokula includes realization of the other. Were impersonal realization to disallow the brahma-vādīs from perceiving their own selves, they would have no impetus to follow their own discipline, because knowledge of Brahman, in the beginning of its development, is too subtle to perceive. Impersonal Brahman cannot be known by the untrained mind, and so for the benefit of neophyte jñānīs the Upaniṣads refer to Brahman merely as tat (“that”), as in the famous aphorism of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (6.8.7) tat tvam asi (“you are that”).

Goloka and Gokula resemble one another down to the details of individual living beings. The individual persons playing the roles in one place may be distinct from those in the other, but the functions they serve in the pleasure pastimes of the Personality of Godhead are exactly the same. Gokula's cowherd men and women and all its creatures, down to the creepers and bushes, closely resemble their counterparts in the spiritual world.

Śrī Sarūpa and his disciple are in Vraja-bhūmi on earth. Now Śrī Sarūpa sees no difference between the two abodes, but before he attained this realization he had to make a great endeavor to transfer himself from Gokula to Goloka.
