## How the Commentary Derives from the DIG-DARŚINĪ-ṬĪKĀ

THIS APPENDIX CONSISTS of two sample passages, Text 121 of Chapter Six and texts 7–9 of Chapter Seven. For each passage the transliterated Sanskrit text and its translation are followed by Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī's ṭīkā, split into individual sentences in transliterated Sanskrit with translation, each sentence numbered for reference. My commentary follows, with bold numbers in brackets indicating the sentences from which the commentary derives.

CHAPTER 6, TEXT 121

tatratya yamunā svalpa-

jalā śuṣkeva sājani

govardhano 'bhūn nīco 'sau

svaḥ-prāpto yo dhṛtas tvayā

In Vraja the river Yamunā has turned so dry she has hardly any water. And Govardhana, who when You held him up touched heaven, has now become short.

[1] pūrvoktaṁ kṣīṇatvaṁ vivṛṇvan śoka-kāraṇatām evāha, tatreti.

Elaborating on the previously mentioned debilitation, how it is a reason for lamentation is described in the verse beginning tatra.

[2] vraja-bhūmi-sambandhinī, sā vipula-taraṅgāvalī parama-gāmbhīryādi-yuktā bhavadīya-tat-tat-krīḍā-bhūmir yamunā svalpa-jalā satī śuṣka-prāyābhūt, bhavad-viyogāt tāpāt.

That Yamunā, who is connected with Vraja-bhūmi, who has ranges of broad waves, who is endowed with great depth and so on, and who is the playground of Your various sports, now has very little water and has become practically dried up, due to the intense suffering caused by separation from You.

[3] atas tasyāṁ praveśena maraṇaṁ na ghaṭata iti bhāvaḥ.

Therefore, the idea is, it is not possible to die by entering her.

[4] bhṛgu-pātenāpi maraṇaṁ na syād ity abhiprāyeṇāha, govardhana iti.

With the idea in mind that death by “Bhṛgu's jump” [a suicidal leap] is also not possible, the words beginning govardhanaḥ are spoken.

[5] tvayā kare dhṛtaḥ san yo govardhanaḥ svargaṁ prāpta iti paramoccatā darśitā.

That Govardhana who reached heaven when held by You in Your hand; this shows how supremely elevated [Govardhana was].

[6] tathā ca hari-vaṁśe, “śikharair ghūrṇamānaiś ca sīdamānaiś ca pādapaiḥ/ vidhṛtaś coddhataiḥ śṛṅgair agamaḥ kha-gamo 'bhavat” iti.

Thus in the Hari-vaṁśa: “When Kṛṣṇa lifted Govardhana, its peaks waved back and forth, the trees upon it trembled, and its inaccessibly high peaks reached outer space.”

[7] tathā ca tatraiva, “āpluto 'yaṁ giriḥ pakṣair iti vidyādharoragāḥ/ gandharvāpasarasaś caiva vāco muñcanti sarvaśaḥ” ity-ādi.

And similarly there itself [in the same Hari-vaṁśa]: “Vidyādharas, Uragas, Gandharvas, and Apsarās complained on all sides that this hill was bumping into their wings,” and so on.

[8] asau nīco 'bhūt, bhavad-viraha-duḥkhena bhūmāntaḥ-praveśāt, śṛṅgāvalī-śilā-caya-skhalanāc ca.

He became low because of entering within the earth in the pain of separation from You, and also because many rocks from his rows of peaks fell down.
